## Understanding CE.SDK Architecture & API[#](#understanding-cesdk-architecture--api)

The following sections provide an overview of the key components of the CE.SDK design editor UI and its API architecture. If you’re ready to start integrating CE.SDK into your React application, check out our [Getting Started guide](nextjs/get-started/overview-e18f40/) or dive into the [guides](nextjs/guides-8d8b00/).

### CreativeEditor Design UI[#](#creativeeditor-design-ui)

The CE.SDK design UI is built for intuitive design creation and editing. Here are the main components and customizable elements within the UI:

![](/docs/cesdk/_astro/CESDK-UI.BD2Iwmum_2gw9UM.webp)

*   **Canvas:** The core interaction area for design content.
*   **Dock:** Entry point for interactions not directly related to the selected design block, often used for accessing asset libraries.
*   **Canvas Menu:** Access block-specific settings like duplication or deletion.
*   **Inspector Bar:** Manage block-specific functionalities, such as adjusting properties of the selected block.
*   **Navigation Bar:** Handles global scene actions like undo/redo and zoom.
*   **Canvas Bar:** Provides tools for managing the overall canvas, such as adding pages or controlling zoom.
*   **Layer Panel:** Manage the stacking order and visibility of design elements.

Learn more about interacting with and manipulating design controls in our design editor UI guide.

### CreativeEngine[#](#creativeengine)

CreativeEngine is the core of CE.SDK, responsible for managing the rendering and manipulation of design scenes. It can be used in headless mode or integrated with the CreativeEditor UI.

Below are key features and APIs provided by the CreativeEngine:

*   **Scene Management:** Create, load, save, and modify design scenes programmatically.
*   **Block Manipulation:** Create and manage design elements, such as shapes, text, and images.
*   **Asset Management:** Load assets like images and SVGs from URLs or local sources.
*   **Variable Management:** Define and manipulate variables within scenes for dynamic content.
*   **Event Handling:** Subscribe to events like block creation or updates for dynamic interaction.

## API Overview[#](#api-overview)

The APIs of CE.SDK are grouped into several categories, reflecting different aspects of scene management and manipulation.

[**Scene API:**](nextjs/concepts/scenes-e8596d/)\- **Creating and Loading Scenes**: `jsx engine.scene.create(); engine.scene.loadFromURL(url);` \- **Zoom Control**: `jsx engine.scene.setZoomLevel(1.0); engine.scene.zoomToBlock(blockId);` [**Block API:**](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/)\- **Creating Blocks**:

```
const block = engine.block.create('shapes/rectangle');
```

*   **Setting Properties**:
    
    ```
    engine.block.setColor(blockId, 'fill/color', { r: 1, g: 0, b: 0, a: 1 });engine.block.setString(blockId, 'text/content', 'Hello World');
    ```
    
*   **Querying Properties**:
    
    ```
    const color = engine.block.getColor(blockId, 'fill/color');const text = engine.block.getString(blockId, 'text/content');
    ```
    
    [**Variable API:**](nextjs/create-templates/add-dynamic-content/text-variables-7ecb50/) Variables allow dynamic content within scenes to programmatically create variations of a design.
    
*   **Managing Variables**:
    
    ```
    engine.variable.setString('myVariable', 'value');const value = engine.variable.getString('myVariable');
    ```
    
    [**Asset API:**](nextjs/import-media/concepts-5e6197/)
*   **Managing Assets**:
    
    ```
    engine.asset.add('image', 'https://example.com/image.png');
    ```
    
    [**Event API:**](nextjs/concepts/events-353f97/)
*   **Subscribing to Events**:
    
    ```
    // Subscribe to scene changesengine.scene.onActiveChanged(() => {  const newActiveScene = engine.scene.get();});
    ```
    

## Customizing the React Creative Editor[#](#customizing-the-react-creative-editor)

CE.SDK provides extensive customization options to adapt the UI to various use cases. These options range from simple configuration changes to more advanced customizations involving callbacks and custom elements.

### Basic Customizations[#](#basic-customizations)

*   **Configuration Object:** When initializing the CreativeEditor, you can pass a configuration object that defines basic settings such as the base URL for assets, the language, theme, and license key.
    
    ```
    const config = {  baseURL:    'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/assets',  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',};
    ```
    
*   **Localization:** Customize the language and labels used in the editor to support different locales.
    
    ```
    const config = {};
    CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk_container', config).then(async cesdk => {  // Set theme using the UI API  cesdk.ui.setTheme('light'); // 'dark' | 'system'  cesdk.i18n.setLocale('en');  cesdk.i18n.setTranslations({    en: {      variables: {        my_custom_variable: {          label: 'Custom Label',        },      },    },  });});
    ```
    
*   [Custom Asset Sources](nextjs/import-media/concepts-5e6197/) : Serve custom image or SVG assets from a remote URL.
    

### UI Customization Options[#](#ui-customization-options)

*   **Theme:** Choose between predefined themes such as ‘dark’, ‘light’, or ‘system’.
    
    ```
    CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk_container', config).then(async cesdk => {  // Set theme using the UI API  cesdk.ui.setTheme('dark'); // 'light' | 'system'});
    ```
    
*   **UI Components:** Enable or disable specific UI components based on your requirements.
    
    ```
    const config = {  ui: {    elements: {      toolbar: true,      inspector: false,    },  },};
    ```
    

## Advanced Customizations[#](#advanced-customizations)

Learn more about extending editor functionality and customizing its UI to your use case by consulting our in-depth [customization guide](nextjs/user-interface/ui-extensions-d194d1/).

Here is an overview of the APIs and components available to you.

### Order APIs[#](#order-apis)

Customization of the web editor’s components and their order within these locations is managed through specific Order APIs, allowing the addition, removal, or reordering of elements.

Each location has its own Order API, e.g., `setDockOrder`, `setCanvasMenuOrder`, `setInspectorBarOrder`, `setNavigationBarOrder`, and `setCanvasBarOrder`.

### Layout Components[#](#layout-components)

CE.SDK provides special components for layout control, such as `ly.img.separator` for separating groups of components and `ly.img.spacer` for adding space between components.

### Registration of New Components[#](#registration-of-new-components)

Custom components can be registered and integrated into the web editor using builder components like buttons, dropdowns, and inputs.

These components can replace default ones or introduce new functionalities, deeply integrating custom logic into the editor.

### Feature API[#](#feature-api)

The Feature API enables conditional display and functionality of components based on the current context, allowing for dynamic customization.

For example, you can hide certain buttons for specific block types.

## Plugins[#](#plugins)

You can customize the CE.SDK web editor during its initialization using the APIs outlined above. For many use cases, this will be adequate.

However, there are times when you might want to encapsulate functionality for reuse. This is where plugins become useful.

Follow our [guide on building your own plugins](nextjs/user-interface/ui-extensions-d194d1/) to learn more or check out one of the plugins we built using this API:

*   **Background Removal**: Adds a button to the canvas menu to remove image backgrounds.
*   [**Vectorizer**](nextjs/edit-image/vectorize-2b4c7f/): Adds a button to the canvas menu to quickly vectorize a graphic.

# To v1.32

Version v1.32 introduced powerful new APIs for customizing the CE.SDK web editor. These new APIs render some of the existing configurations obsolete, requiring code migration to leverage the more flexible new options.

This guide will help you navigate these changes and explain what you need to do to update your integration.

## Configuring the Dock[#](#configuring-the-dock)

Until version 1.32, the dock was configured by two configuration options (although most users only used one of them and kept the others default):

*   `config.ui.elements.libraries.insert.entries` and
*   `config.ui.elements.dock`

If your configuration adapted one of these two (mostly `config.ui.elements.libraries.insert.entries`), you are affected by this change. For now, it is only deprecated and we will try to do an internal migration for you, but this still might include a breaking change depending on how you used the configuration options before.

### Breaking Change[#](#breaking-change)

`config.ui.elements.libraries.insert.entries` was called repeatedly with a context of currently selected blocks. Most users and configurations have not used this behavior and just returned the same static list of entries for every call. In this case, your configuration should work as before, but if you have relied on this fact, you have to migrate your configuration to the new API, listen to selection changes, and update the asset library entries accordingly.

### Migration to new APIs[#](#migration-to-new-apis)

Defining the dock is now done by our new APIs in a consistent way to all other customizable locations of the editor. With the [Dock API](nextjs/user-interface/customization/dock-cb916c/), you now have much greater control of how and what is displayed in the dock. This does not only include dock buttons to open asset libraries but also arbitrary buttons and other elements. Please take a look at the [Dock API](nextjs/user-interface/customization/dock-cb916c/) or learn about the general concept [here](nextjs/user-interface/overview-41101a/).

If you aren’t affected by the breaking change mentioned above, the easiest way to migrate is to first copy your current dock order after the editor has been inialized. This can be done by calling the new `cesdk.ui.getDockOrder()` method. Now you can take this order and set it during the initialization of the editor by using `cesdk.ui.setDockOrder(copiedDockOrder)`. The old configuration (`config.ui.elements.libraries.insert.entries` and `config.ui.elements.dock`) can be removed afterwards.

Of course, you could also just remove the old configuration and use the new API to define the dock order from scratch.

Please note, that changes to the asset library entries are now done by the [Asset Library Entry API](nextjs/import-media/asset-panel/basics-f29078/) and the dock order is just referring to these. So if you, for instance, want to add an asset source id to be shown in a library, you have to add this asset source id to the asset library entry and not to the dock order.

```
// Before// ======const config: Configuration = {  ui: {    elements: {      libraries: {        insert: {          entries: (defaultEntries) => {            return [              // Changing some of the default entries              ...defaultEntries.map((entry) => {                if (entry.id === 'ly.img.image') {                  entry.sourceIds.push('my-own-image-source');                }                return entry;              }),              // Adding a new entry              {                id: 'my-own-entry',                sourceIds: ['my-own-source']              }            ];          }        }      }    }  }};
// After// ======cesdk.ui.setDockOrder([  ...cesdk.ui.getDockOrder(),  // Add a new button referencing your new entry  {    id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock',    label: 'My Own Entry',    icon: [...],    entries: ['my-own-entry']  }]);
// Adding your custom entrycesdk.ui.addAssetLibraryEntry({  id: 'my-own-entry',  sourceIds: ['my-own-source']});
// Updating an existing default entrycesdk.ui.updateAssetLibraryEntry('ly.img.image', {  sourceIds: ({ currentIds }) => [...currentIds, 'my-own-image-source']});
```

## Configuring the Asset Replacement Panel[#](#configuring-the-asset-replacement-panel)

Similar to the definition of the dock, we deprecate the configuration `config.ui.elements.libraries.replace.entries` of the asset library entries for the replacement panel. This method is deprecated but we will try to migrate your configuration internally until it is removed. We recommend you to migrate to the new API as soon as possible.

The new API is similar with subtle differences. With `cesdk.ui.setReplaceAssetLibraryEntries` you register a function that is called with the current context (of selected blocks) but only returns ids of entries.

### Breaking Change[#](#breaking-change-1)

With the `config.ui.elements.libraries.replace.entries` it was possible to take the default entries and modify them. In theory, you could change the entries and have different “default” entries for insert or replace. Now a change to a default entry provided by the editor via the [Asset Library Entry API](nextjs/import-media/asset-panel/basics-f29078/) will be reflected in both the insert and replace entries. To solve this you can just copy one entry for replacement, modify it, and return its id instead.

### Migration to new APIs[#](#migration-to-new-apis-1)

Take the function from `config.ui.elements.libraries.replace.entries` and use it in `cesdk.ui.setReplaceAssetLibraryEntries` by replacing the entries with their ids. If you have made changes to the default entries or added new custom ones you need to add or change them via the [Asset Library Entry API](nextjs/import-media/asset-panel/basics-f29078/) on initialization of the editor.

# To v1.19

Version v1.19 of CreativeEngineSDK and CreativeEditorSDK introduces structural changes to many of the current design blocks, making them more composable and more powerful. Along with this update, there are mandatory license changes that require attention. This comes with a number of breaking changes. This document will explain the changes and describe the steps you need to take to adapt them to your setup.

## **License Changes**[#](#license-changes)

The `license` parameter is now required for CreativeEngineSDK and CreativeEditorSDK. This means that you will need to update your license parameter in the `CreativeEngine.init` and `CreativeEditorSDK.create` configuration object properties. There is also a new `userId`, an optional unique ID tied to your application’s user. This helps us accurately calculate monthly active users (MAU). Especially useful when one person uses the app on multiple devices with a sign-in feature, ensuring they’re counted once. Providing this aids in better data accuracy.

## **Graphic Design Block**[#](#graphic-design-block)

A new generic `Graphic` design block with the type id `//ly.img.ubq/graphic` has been introduced, which forms the basis of the new unified block structure.

## **Shapes**[#](#shapes)

Similar to how the fill of a block is a separate object which can be attached to and replaced on a design block, we have now introduced a similar concept for the shape of a block.

You use the new `createShape`, `getShape` and `setShape` APIs in order to define the shape of a design block. Only the new `//ly.img.ubq/graphic` block allows for its shape to be changed with these APIs.

The new available shape types are:

*   `//ly.img.ubq/shape/rect`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shape/line`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shape/ellipse`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shape/polygon`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shape/star`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shape/vector_path`

The following block types are now removed in favor of using a `Graphic` block with one of the above mentioned shape instances:

*   `//ly.img.ubq/shapes/rect`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shapes/line`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shapes/ellipse`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shapes/polygon`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shapes/star`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/vector_path`

(The removed type ids use the plural “shapes” and the new shape types use the singular “shape”)

This structural change means that the shape-specific properties (e.g. the number of sides of a polygon) are not available on the design block any more but on the shape instances instead. You will have to add calls to `getShape` to get the instance id of the shape instance and then pass that to the property getter and setter APIs.

Also remember to change property key strings in the getter and setter calls from the plural `shapes/…` to the singular `shape/…` to match the new type identifiers.

## **Image and Sticker**[#](#image-and-sticker)

Previously, `//ly.img.ubq/image` and `//ly.img.ubq/sticker` were their own high-level design block types. They do not support the fill APIs nor the effects APIs.

Both of these blocks are now removed in favor of using a `Graphic` block with an image fill (`//ly.img.ubq/fill/image`) and using the effects APIs instead of the legacy image block’s numerous effects properties.

At its core, the sticker block has always just been an image block that is heavily limited in its capabilities. You can not crop it, nor apply any effects to it. In order to replicate this difference as closely as possible in the new unified structure, more fine-grained scopes have been added. You can now limit the adopter’s ability to crop a block and to edit its appearance.

Note that since these scopes only apply to a user of the editor with the “Adopter” role, a “Creator” user will now have all of the same editing options for both images and for blocks that used to be stickers.

## **Scopes**[#](#scopes)

The following is the list of changes to the design block scopes:

*   (Breaking) The permission to crop a block was split from `content/replace` and `design/style` into a separate scope: `layer/crop`.
*   Deprecated the `design/arrange` scope and renamed `design/arrange/move` → `layer/move` `design/arrange/resize` → `layer/resize` `design/arrange/rotate` → `layer/rotate` `design/arrange/flip` → `layer/flip`
*   Deprecated the `content/replace` scope. For `//ly.img.ubq/text` blocks, it is replaced with the new `text/edit` scope. For other blocks it is replaced with `fill/change`.
*   Deprecated the `design/style` scope and replaced it with the following fine-grained scopes: `text/character`, `stroke/change`, `layer/opacity`, `layer/blendMode`, `layer/visibility`, `layer/clipping`, `appearance/adjustments`, `appearance/filter`, `appearance/effect`, `appearance/blur`, `appearance/shadow`
*   Introduced `fill/change`, `stroke/change`, and `shape/change` scopes that control whether the fill, stroke or shape of a block may be edited by a user with an “Adopter” role.
*   The deprecated scopes are automatically mapped to their new corresponding scopes by the scope APIs for now until they will be removed completely in a future update.

## **Kind**[#](#kind)

While the new unified block structure both simplifies a lot of code and makes design blocks more powerful, it also means that many of the design blocks that used to have unique type ids now all have the same generic `//ly.img.ubq/graphic` type, which means that calls to the `findByType` cannot be used to filter blocks based on their legacy type ids any more.

Simultaneously, there are many instances in which different blocks in the scene which might have the same type and underlying technical structure have different semantic roles in the document and should therefore be treated differently by the user interface.

To solve both of these problems, we have introduced the concept of a block “kind”. This is a mutable string that can be used to tag different blocks with a semantic label.

You can get the kind of a block using the `getKind` API and you can query blocks with a specific kind using the `findByKind` API.

CreativeEngine provides the following default kind values:

*   `image`
*   `video`
*   `sticker`
*   `scene`
*   `camera`
*   `stack`
*   `page`
*   `audio`
*   `text`
*   `shape`
*   `group`

Unlike the immutable design block type id, you can change the kind of a block with the new `setKind` API.

It is important to remember that the underlying structure and properties of a design block are not strictly defined by its kind, since the kind, shape, fill and effects of a block can be changed independent of each other. Therefore, a user-interface should not make assumptions about available properties of a block purely based on its kind.

**Note**

Due to legacy reasons, blocks with the kind “sticker” will continue to not allow their contents to be cropped. This special behavior will be addressed and replaced with a more general-purpose implementation in a future update.

​

## **Asset Definitions**[#](#asset-definitions)

The asset definitions have been updated to reflect the deprecation of legacy block type ids and the introduction of the “kind” property.

In addition to the “blockType” meta property, you can now also define the `“shapeType”` ,`“fillType”` and `“kind”` of the block that should be created by the default implementation of the applyAsset function.

*   `“blockType”` defaults to `“//ly.img.ubq/graphic”` if left unspecified.
*   `“shapeType”` defaults to `“//ly.img.ubq/shape/rect”` if left unspecified
*   `“fillType”` defaults to `“//ly.img.ubq/fill/color”` if left unspecified

Video block asset definitions used to specify the `“blockType”` as `“//ly.img.ubq/fill/video“`. The `“fillType”` meta asset property should now be used instead for such fill type ids.

## **Automatic Migration**[#](#automatic-migration)

CreativeEngine will always continue to support scene files that contain the now removed legacy block types. Those design blocks will be automatically replaced by the equivalent new unified block structure when the scene is loaded, which means that the types of all legacy blocks will change to `“//ly.img.ubq/graphic”`.

Note that this can mean that a block gains new capabilities that it did not have before. For example, the line shape block did not have any stroke properties, so the `hasStroke` API used to return `false`. However, after the automatic migration its `Graphic` design block replacement supports both strokes and fills, so the `hasStroke` API now returns `true` . Similarly, the image block did not support fills or effects, but the `Graphic` block does.

## List of all Removed Block Type IDs[#](#list-of-all-removed-block-type-ids)

*   `//ly.img.ubq/image`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/sticker`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shapes/rect`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shapes/line`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shapes/ellipse`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shapes/polygon`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shapes/star`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/vector_path`

## **UI Configuration**[#](#ui-configuration)

The configuration options for the legacy blocks have also been removed under `config.ui.elements.blocks` and a new configuration option for the `ly.img.ubq/graphic` block type have been introduced which will then define which UI controls to enable for graphic blocks (crop, filters, adjustments, effects, blur). This new configuration option follows the same structure as before.

Here is a list of the deprecated block configuration options:

*   `//ly.img.ubq/image`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/fill/video`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shapes/rect`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shapes/line`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shapes/star`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shapes/polygon`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/shapes/ellipse`
*   `//ly.img.ubq/vector_path`

## Translations[#](#translations)

Some of the translation keys related to Scopes and Placeholder-Settings have been also updated:

*   Removed the following keys:
    *   `scope.content.replace`
    *   `scope.design.arrange`
    *   `scope.design.style`
*   Renamed the following keys:
    *   `scope.design.arrange.flip` is now `scope.layer.flip`
    *   `scope.design.arrange.move` is now `scope.layer.move`
    *   `scope.design.arrange.resize` is now `scope.layer.resize`
    *   `scope.design.arrange.rotate` is now `scope.layer.rotate`
*   Added the following keys:
    *   `component.placeholder.appearance.description`
    *   `component.placeholder.appearance`
    *   `component.placeholder.arrange.description`
    *   `component.placeholder.arrange`
    *   `component.placeholder.disableAll`
    *   `component.placeholder.enableAll`
    *   `component.placeholder.fill.description`
    *   `component.placeholder.fill`
    *   `component.placeholder.general.description`
    *   `component.placeholder.general`
    *   `component.placeholder.shape.description`
    *   `component.placeholder.shape`
    *   `component.placeholder.stroke.description`
    *   `component.placeholder.stroke`
    *   `component.placeholder.text.description`
    *   `component.placeholder.text`
    *   `scope.appearance.adjustments`
    *   `scope.appearance.blur`
    *   `scope.appearance.effect`
    *   `scope.appearance.filter`
    *   `scope.appearance.shadow`
    *   `scope.fill.change`
    *   `scope.layer.blendMode`
    *   `scope.layer.opacity`
    *   `scope.shape.change`
    *   `scope.stroke.change`
    *   `scope.text.character`
    *   `scope.text.edit`

## **Types and API Signatures**[#](#types-and-api-signatures)

To improve the type safety of our APIs, we have moved away from using the `DesignBlockType` enum and replaced with a set of types. Those changes have affected the following APIs:

*   `CESDK.engine.block.create()`
*   `CESDK.engine.block.createFill()`
*   `CESDK.engine.block.createEffect()`
*   `CESDK.engine.block.createBlur()`
*   `CESDK.engine.block.findByType()`
*   `CESDK.engine.block.getType()`

**Note**

The `create`, `findByType`, and `getType` APIs will no longer accept the IDs of the deprecated legacy blocks and will throw an error when those are passed

## **Code Examples**[#](#code-examples)

This section will show some code examples of the breaking changes and how it would look like after migrating.

```
/** Block Creation */
// Creating an Image before migrationconst image = cesdk.engine.block.create('image');cesdk.engine.block.setString(  image,  'image/imageFileURI',  'https://domain.com/link-to-image.jpg',);

# To v1.13

In version v1.13, the way the CreativeEngine and CreativeEditor SDK are configured has changed. Several configuration options that were previously passed to `CreativeEngine.init()` or `CreativeEditor SDK.init()` have been removed or replaced. This document will explain the changes and describe the steps you can take to adapt them to your setup.

#### CreativeEditorSDK initialization[#](#creativeeditorsdk-initialization)

We are also introducing a new way of instantiating the CreativeEditorSDK, that provides more precise control over the initialization. Using `CreativeEditorSDK.create()`, you have the chance to configure the SDK before loading or creating a scene. This was not possible before. When using `CreativeEditorSDK.init()`, the SDK would create the initial scene before giving you the option to perform additional configuration via the API.

The `create()` method will not create an initial scene for you. You need to do that yourself, using either the Scene API at `cesdk.editor.scene`, or one of the methods on the CreativeEditorSDK instance itself (`createDesignScene`, `createVideoScene`, `loadFromUrl`, `loadFromString`).

### Rationale[#](#rationale)

Over time the number options you could pass into the call to `CreativeEngine.init({...config})` has grown quite a bit. Initially this was the only place where you could configure the behavior and settings of the CreativeEngine, but over the past year we introduced several new APIs. One of those APIs is the EditorAPI, which lets you

[adjust](nextjs/settings-970c98/) many [settings](nextjs/settings-970c98/) at runtime, not just at the launch of the app.

To improve consistency of our APIs, we decided to scale back the options available in the configuration object in favor of changing settings via the EditorAPI. The only options that remain are those that are strictly necessary for the initialization of the CreativeEngine, such as the `baseUrl` and `license`.

These changes were performed with the Creative Engine in mind, but since the CreativeEditor SDK shares a lot of the same code, the changes described in this document also apply to the configuration for the CE.SDK.

### Changed configuration options[#](#changed-configuration-options)

The following is a list of all configuration options that have been changed or removed, along with instructions on how to migrate the use of these options in your codebase:

*   `scene` options (`dpi`, `pixelScaleFactor`) have been removed. `scene/dpi` and `scene/pixelScaleFactor` can now be found as [properties on the scene in the BlockAPI](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/).
*   `page` options have been removed.
    *   `page.title.show` has been replaced with `cesdk.engine.editor.setSettingBool('page/title/show', enabled)`
    *   `page.title.fontFileUri` has been replaced with `cesdk.engine.editor.setSettingString('page/title/fontFileUri', uri)`
    *   `page.dimOutOfPageAreas` has been replaced with `cesdk.engine.editor.setSettingBool('page/dimOutOfPageAreas', dimEnabled)`
*   `assetSources` have been removed. To add asset sources, use the AssetAPI at `cesdk.engine.asset`.
*   `preset.colors` has been removed as it was never used, previously.
*   `presets.colorPalettes` has been removed from CreativeEngine as it was not used. It has been moved to `ui.colorPalette` in the CESDK.
*   `presets.images` has been removed. To add assets and asset sources, use the AssetAPI at `cesdk.engine.asset`.
*   `presets.pageFormats` has been removed from the CreativeEngine as it was not used. Is has been moved to `ui.pageFormats` in the CESDK. Previously it was possible to mark a page format as default by setting `meta: {default: true}` in it. In `ui.pageFormats`, this has been simplified, to just `default: true`.
*   `variables` has been removed. Use the [VariableAPI](nextjs/create-templates/add-dynamic-content/text-variables-7ecb50/) instead.
*   `callbacks.log` has been moved to `logger`. Previously the logger callback would take a `Loglevel` enum as a second parameter. This enum has been removed. Instead you can define the loglevel with plain strings `'Warning' | 'Error' | 'Info'`

### Change initialization code[#](#change-initialization-code)

To ensure your users perceive a consistent UI experience, settings that have been moved to api calls should be made immediately after initializing the CreativeEngine. For the Creative Editor SDK, use the `create()` method, instead of `init()`

#### CreativeEngine[#](#creativeengine)

```
const engine = await CreativeEngine.init(config);// 1. Configure Engineengine.editor.setSettingEnum('doubleClickSelectionMode', 'Direct');// ... other settings
// 2. Create/load sceneconst sceneId = await engine.scene.create();
// 3. Append Engine canvas element to the DOMdocument.getElementById('my-engine-container').append(engine.element);
// ... your application code
```

#### CreativeEngine SDK[#](#creativeengine-sdk)

```
const cesdk = await CreativeEditorSDK.create('my-engine-container', config);// 1. Configure SDKcesdk.engine.asset.addSource(myAssetSource);// ... other settings
// 2. Create/load sceneconst sceneId = await cesdk.createDesignScene(myPageFormats[pageFormatId]);
// ... your application code
```

### Fallback and warnings[#](#fallback-and-warnings)

The CreativeEngine and CreativeEditor SDK still interpret the config object with its previous settings. If removed configuration options are detected during intialization, a warning is printed to the console, with individual instructions on how to migrate them. It is recommended to adjust your configuration as described above for the best compatibility with future developments and to get rid of these warnings.

The fallback mechanism is not enabled for the new `CreativeEditorSDK.create()` method! Passing removed configuration options to `create()` will cause that option to be ignored and an error will be printed to the console.

### CreativeEngine Typescript definitions[#](#creativeengine-typescript-definitions)

The more complex parts of our configuration (such as the page format definitions) were previously exporting type definitions under the `ConfigTypes` namespace in the CreativeEngine package. This namespace and all the types in it have been removed or moved elsewhere.

For now we still export `ConfigTypes`, but have marked it and its members as `@deprecated`. Most of them are not used at all anymore, the rest have been moved elsewhere:

*   `ConfigTypes.Color` can now be imported directly as `PaletteColor`
*   `ConfigTypes.TypefaceDefinition` can be imported directly, as `TypefaceDefinition`.
*   `ConfigTypes.PageFormatDefinition` can be imported directly as `PageFormatDefinition` (CE.SDK only).
*   `ConfigTypes.Logger` can be imported directly as `Logger`

The `LogLevel` enum that was previously used by `Logger` has been replaced with a string union (`'Warning' | 'Error' | 'Info'`).

### CreativeEditorSDK Typescript definitions[#](#creativeeditorsdk-typescript-definitions)

The CreativeEditor SDK package still _does_ export a `ConfigTypes` namespace.

For use with the new `CreativeEditorSDK.create()`, we are offering a new type `CreateConfiguration`, which is lacking all of the removed keys instead of marking them as deprecated.

### Demo asset sources[#](#demo-asset-sources)

When adding demo asset sources using `cesdk.addDemoAssetSources()`, or `engine.addDemoAssetSources()`, make sure to specify the correct scene mode. The installed demo asset sources vary between Design and Video modes.

If you don’t specify a scene mode, `addDemoAssetSources()` will try to add the correct sources based on the current scene, and default to `'Design'`. If you call `addDemoAssetSources()` _without_ a scene mode, and _before_ loading or creating a video scene, the audio and video asset sources will not be added.

# To v1.10

Version v1.10 introduced major changes to how and where engine and the UI store assets. This guide helps you navigate those changes and explains what you need to do to bring your integration up to speed.

## 1\. Scene Uploads are no longer serialized[#](#1-scene-uploads-are-no-longer-serialized)

Image uploads are no longer stored in the scene and will not reappear upon scene load. To offer specific assets in your editor, configure and [add an asset source](nextjs/serve-assets-b0827c/) containing the desired assets.

## 2\. Deprecating Extensions[#](#2-deprecating-extensions)

Starting with `v1.10` we fully embrace [Asset Sources](nextjs/import-media/from-remote-source/unsplash-8f31f0/) as our standard interface for asset management. We’re deprecating extension packs, previously stored in `/assets/extensions` and indexed via `manifest.json` files.

**Fonts are not affected by this deprecation yet, but will receive the same treatment in an upcoming version.**

We’ll deprecate the `config.extensions` field for `CreativeEditorSDK`. As part of this deprecation, we’ll **no longer ship** the following packs in the `/assets/extensions` directory in our `npm` packages:

*   `ly.img.cesdk.images.samples`
*   `ly.img.cesdk.shapes.default`
*   `ly.img.cesdk.stickers.doodle`
*   `ly.img.cesdk.stickers.emoji`
*   `ly.img.cesdk.stickers.emoticons`
*   `ly.img.cesdk.stickers.hand`
*   `ly.img.cesdk.vectorpaths`
*   `ly.img.cesdk.vectorpaths.abstract`

To keep offering the contained assets in your deployment, use our new [convenience functions](#making-use-of-default-and-demo-asset-sources) to instantiate asset sources holding these assets. If you have existing scenes where an asset from an extension pack might be included, you must make sure you’re still serving the corresponding files from your baseURL, so that `<baseURL>/extensions/…` paths still resolve properly. You can acquire a copy of the extension packs shipped in `v1.9.2` [from our CDN](https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.9.2/assets/extensions.zip). Otherwise your scenes will **render missing asset alerts**.

### 2.1 Making use of Default and Demo Asset Sources[#](#21-making-use-of-default-and-demo-asset-sources)

We still want to offer a package, that has all batteries included and quickly gets you up to speed. To do so, we introduced two new convenience functions, that can be used to add a set of predefined asset sources to your integration:

#### `addDefaultAssetSources`[#](#adddefaultassetsources)

Adds a set of asset sources containing our default assets.

These assets may be used in production and [served from your own servers](nextjs/serve-assets-b0827c/). The assets are parsed from the IMG.LY CDN at `{{base_url}}/<id>/content.json`, where `base_url` defaults to `https://cdn.img.ly/assets/v1`. Each source is created via `addLocalSource` and populated with the parsed assets. You can specify your own `base_url` or exclude certain source IDs.

The following sources are added:

| ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `'ly.img.sticker'` | Various stickers |
| `'ly.img.vectorpath'` | Shapes and arrows |
| `'ly.img.filter.lut'` | LUT effects of various kinds. |
| `'ly.img.filter.duotone'` | Color effects of various kinds. |

#### `addDemoAssetSources`[#](#adddemoassetsources)

Registers a set of demo asset sources containing our example assets. These are not to meant to be used in your production code.

The assets are parsed from the IMG.LY CDN at `https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v1`. The `sceneMode` and `withUploadAssetSources` parameters control whether audio/video and upload sources are added.

The following sources are added:

| ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `'ly.img.image'` | Sample images |
| `'ly.img.image.upload'` | Demo source to upload image assets |
| `'ly.img.audio'` | Sample audios |
| `'ly.img.audio.upload'` | Demo source to upload audio assets |
| `'ly.img.video'` | Sample audios |
| `'ly.img.video.upload'` | Demo source to upload video assets |

#### Modifying Default & Demo Sources[#](#modifying-default--demo-sources)

After registration you can freely modify the contained assets using the Asset APIs. You can add or remove entire asset sources or individual assets.

#### Upload Asset Sources[#](#upload-asset-sources)

The upload asset sources and library entries for video and audio were added to the default configuration from `addDefaultAssetSources`. If you have added these sources manually (like mentioned in our video docs) you can remove them now.

## 3\. AssetAPI Changes[#](#3-assetapi-changes)

To further streamline interaction, the following breaking changes were made to the AssetAPI:

*   The `applyAsset` callbacks and `defaultApplyAsset` API now return an optional design block id in their callback if they created a new block.
*   `thumbUri` and `size` properties in `AssetDefinition` and `AssetResult` are now part of the `meta` property dictionary.
*   Values of the `blockType` asset meta property must now be design block type ids (e.g. `//ly.img.ubq/image`)

## 4\. A New Way to Add Images[#](#4-a-new-way-to-add-images)

Instead of specifying additional images for the `CreativeEditorSDK` in `config.presets.images`, you should make use of `asset.addAsset` and add your images into the `ly.img.image` asset source.

## 5\. General API Changes[#](#5-general-api-changes)

The `blockType` `meta` property for assets changed from `ly.img.<type>` to fully qualified block types: E.g. `'ly.img.image'` now needs to be `'//ly.img.ubq/image'`.

As we’re starting to apply the ‘fill’ concept to more parts of the interface, we deprecated various fill color related APIs:

*   Deprecated `hasFillColor`, use `hasFill` and query `block.getEnum(id, 'fill/type')` for `Solid` type instead.
*   Deprecated `get/setFillColorRGBA`, use `setFillSolidColor`instead..
*   Deprecated `isFillColorEnabled`, use `isFillEnabled` instead.
*   Deprecated `setFillType` and `setFillGradientType`, use `createFill`, e.g., with type ‘color’ and then apply the fill block with `setFill` to the block instead. If the block has a fill, it should be removed with `getFill` and `destroy`.
*   Deprecated `getFillType` and `getFillGradientType`, query `block.getEnum(id, 'fill/type')` and `block.getEnum(id, 'fill/gradient/type')` instead instead
*   Deprecated `add/removeFillGradientColorStop` and `get/setFillGradientColorStops`.
*   Deprecated `get/setFillGradientControlPointX/Y`, use `block.getFloat(fill, keypath)` and `block.setFloat(fill, keypath, value)` with key paths ‘fill/gradient/linear/startPointX/Y’, ‘fill/gradient/radial/centerPointX/Y’, and ‘fill/gradient/conical/centerPointX/Y’ instead.
*   Deprecated `get/setFillGradientRadius`, use `block.getFloat(fill, 'fill/gradient/radial/radius')` and `block.setFloat(fill, 'fill/gradient/radial/radius', value)` instead.”

`camera/clearColor` property was replaced it with a global `clearColor` setting to allow controlling the clear color before loading a scene.

Properties affecting playback that existed on both `Audio` and `VideoFill` where moved to a common `playback/` namespace:

*   `'fill/video/looping'` and `'audio/looping'` are now `'playback/looping'`
*   `'fill/video/volume'` and `'audio/volume'` are now `'playback/volume'`
*   `'fill/video/muted'` and `'audio/muted'` are now `'playback/muted'`

# Serve Assets From Your Server

In this example, we explain how to configure the Creative Engine to use assets hosted on your own servers. While we serve all assets from our own CDN by default, it is highly recommended to serve the assets from your own servers in a production environment.

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites)

*   [Get the latest stable version of **Node.js & NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
*   (Optional): [Get the latest stable version of **Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started)

## 1\. Add the CreativeEngine to Your Project[#](#1-add-the-creativeengine-to-your-project)

Terminal window

```
npm install @cesdk/engine# oryarn add @cesdk/engine
```

## 2\. Decide what Assets you need[#](#2-decide-what-assets-you-need)

We offer two sets of assets:

*   _Core_ Assets - Files required for the engine to function.
*   _Default_ Assets - Demo assets to quickstart your development.

### ⚠️ Warning

  

Prior to `v1.10.0`, the `CreativeEngine` and `CreativeEditorSDK` would load referenced default assets from the `assets/extensions/*` directories and hardcode them as `/extensions/…` references in serialized scenes.

  

To **maintain compatibility** for such scenes, make sure you’re still serving version v1.9.2 the `/extensions` directory from your `baseURL`. You can [download them from our CDN](https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.9.2/assets/extensions.zip).

## 3\. Register IMG.LY’s default assets[#](#3-register-imglys-default-assets)

If you want to use our default asset sources in your integration, call `CreativeEngine.addDefaultAssetSources({ baseURL?: string, excludeAssetSourceIds?: string[] }): void`. Right after initialization:

```
CreativeEngine.init(config).then(engine => {  engine.addDefaultAssetSources();});
```

This call adds IMG.LY’s default asset sources for stickers, vectorpaths and filters to your engine instance. By default, these include the following source ids:

*   `'ly.img.sticker'` - Various stickers.
*   `'ly.img.vectorpath'` - Shapes and arrows.
*   `'ly.img.filter.lut'` - LUT effects of various kinds.
*   `'ly.img.filter.duotone'` - Color effects of various kinds.
*   `'ly.img.colors.defaultPalette'` - Default color palette.
*   `'ly.img.effect'` - Default effects.
*   `'ly.img.blur'` - Default blurs.
*   `'ly.img.typeface'` - Default typefaces.

If you don’t specify a `baseURL` option, the assets are parsed and served from the IMG.LY CDN. It’s it is highly recommended to serve the assets from your own servers in a production environment, if you decide to use them. To do so, follow the steps below and pass a `baseURL` option to `addDefaultAssetSources`. If you only need a subset of the IDs above, use the `excludeAssetSourceIds` option to pass a list of ignored Ids.

## 4\. Copy Assets[#](#4-copy-assets)

Copy the CreativeEditorSDK `core`, `demo`, `i18n`, `ui`, etc. asset folders to your application’s asset folder. The name of the folder depends on your setup and the used bundler, but it’s typically a folder called `assets` or `public` in the project root.

Terminal window

```
cp -r ./node_modules/@cesdk/engine/assets public/
```

Furthermore, if you are using our IMG.LY default assets, download them from [our CDN](https://cdn.img.ly/assets/v4/IMGLY-Assets.zip) and extract them to your public directory as well.

If you deploy the site that embeds the CreativeEngine together with all its assets and static files, this might be all you need to do for this step.

In different setups, you might need to upload this folder to your CDN.

## 5\. Configure the CreativeEngine to use your self-hosted assets[#](#5-configure-the-creativeengine-to-use-your-self-hosted-assets)

Next, we need to configure the SDK to use our local assets instead of the ones served via our CDN. There are two configuration options that are relevant for this:

*   `baseURL` should ideally point to the `assets` folder that was copied in the previous step.
    
    This can be either an absolute URL, or a path. A path will be resolved using the `window.location.href` of the page where the CreativeEngine is embedded. By default `baseURL` is set to our CDN.
    
*   `core.baseURL` must point to the folder containing the core sources and data file for the CreativeEngine. Defaults to `${baseURL}/core`
    
    This can be either an absolute URL, or a relative path. A relative path will be resolved using the the previous `baseURL`. By default, `core.baseURL` is set to `core/`.
    
    Normally you would simply serve the assets directory from the previous step. That directory already contains the `core` folder, and this setting does not need to be changed. For highly customized setups that separate hosting of the WASM files from the hosting of other assets that are used inside scenes, you can set this to a different URL.
    
*   `CreativeEngine.addDefaultAssetSources` offers a `baseURL` option, that needs to be set to an absolute URL.
    
    The given URL will be used to lookup the asset definitions from `{{baseURL}}/<id>/content.json` and for all file references, like `{{baseURL}}/<id>/images/example.png`. By default, default sources parse and reference assets from `https://cdn.img.ly/assets/v4`.
    

```
  const config = {    ...    // Specify baseURL for all relative URLs.    baseURL: '/assets' // or 'https://cdn.mydomain.com/assets'    core: {      // Specify location of core assets, required by the engine.      baseURL: 'core/'    },    ...  };
  // Setup engine and add default sources served from your own server.  CreativeEngine.init(config).then((engine) => {    engine.addDefaultAssetSources({ baseURL: 'https://cdn.mydomain.com/assets'})  })
```

## Versioning of the WASM assets[#](#versioning-of-the-wasm-assets)

The files that the CreativeEngine loads from `core.baseURL` (`.wasm` and`.data` files, and the `worker-host.js`) are changing between different versions of the CreativeEngine. You need to ensure that after a version update, you update your copy of the assets.

The filenames of these assets will also change between updates. This makes it safe to store different versions of these files in the same folder during migrations, as the CreativeEngine will always locate the correct files using the unique filenames.

It also means that if you forget to copy the new assets, the CreativeEngine will fail to load them during initialization and abort with an Error message on the console. Depending on your setup this might only happen in your production or staging environments, but not during development where the assets might be served from a local server. Thus we recommend to ensure that copying of the assets is taken care of by your automated deployments and not performed manually.

# Security

This document provides a comprehensive overview of CE.SDK’s security practices, focusing on data handling, privacy, and our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of security for our customers and their end users.

## Key Security Features[#](#key-security-features)

*   **Client-Side Processing**: All image and design processing occurs directly on the user’s device, not on our servers
*   **No Data Transmission**: Your content (e.g. images, designs, templates, videos, audio, etc.) is never uploaded to or processed on IMG.LY servers
*   **Minimal Data Collection**: We only collect device identifiers and count exports for licensing purposes
*   **GDPR Compliance**: Our data collection practices adhere to GDPR regulations
*   **Secure Licensing**: Enterprise licenses are secured with RSA SHA256 encryption

## Data Protection & Access Controls[#](#data-protection--access-controls)

### Data Collection[#](#data-collection)

CE.SDK requires minimal data to provide its services. The only potentially personally identifiable information (PII) collected includes device-specific identifiers such as `identifierForVendor` on iOS and `ANDROID_ID` on Android. These identifiers are:

*   Used solely for tracking monthly active users for our usage-based pricing models
*   Reset when the user reinstalls the app or resets their device
*   Collected under GDPR’s legitimate interest provision (no explicit consent required as they are necessary for our licensing system)

Additionally, we track export operations for billing purposes in usage-based pricing models.

For enterprise customers who prefer more accurate tracking, integrators can provide their own userID. This allows for more precise measurement of usage without requiring additional device identifiers.

### Data Storage & Encryption[#](#data-storage--encryption)

**We do not collect or store user data beyond the device identifiers and export counts mentioned above.** Since CE.SDK operates entirely client-side:

*   All content processing happens on the user’s device
*   No images, designs, or user content is transmitted to IMG.LY servers
*   No content data is stored on IMG.LY infrastructure

We use standard HTTPS (SSL/TLS) encryption for all communications between CE.SDK instances and our licensing backend.

### Access Controls[#](#access-controls)

We are using established industry standard practices to handle sensitive customer data. Therefore access control concerns are minimized. The limited data we do handle is protected as follows:

*   Billing information is stored in Stripe and accessed only by members of our finance team and C-level executives
*   API keys and credentials are stored securely in 1Password or GitHub with granular access levels
*   All employees sign Confidentiality Agreements to protect customer information

This refers to data of our direct customers, not their users or customers.

## Licensing System[#](#licensing-system)

CE.SDK uses a licensing system that works as follows:

1.  During instantiation, an API key is provided to the CE.SDK instance
2.  This API key is held in memory (never stored permanently on the device)
3.  The SDK validates the key with our licensing backend
4.  Upon successful validation, the backend returns a temporary local license
5.  This license is periodically refreshed to maintain valid usage

For browser implementations, we protect licenses against misuse by pinning them to specific domains. For mobile applications, licenses are pinned to the application identifiers to prevent unauthorized use.

For enterprise customers, we offer an alternative model:

*   A license file is passed directly to the instance
*   No communication with our licensing service is required
*   Licenses are secured using RSA SHA256 encryption

## Security Considerations for User Input[#](#security-considerations-for-user-input)

As CE.SDK deals primarily with arbitrary user input, we’ve implemented specific security measures to handle data safely:

*   The CreativeEngine reads files from external resources to fetch images, fonts, structured data, and other sources for designs. These reads are safeguarded by platform-specific default measures.
*   The engine never loads executable code or attempts to execute any data acquired from dynamic content. It generally relies on provided mime types to decode image data or falls back to byte-level inspection to choose the appropriate decoder.
*   For data writing operations, we provide a callback that returns a pointer to the to-be-written data. The engine itself never unconditionally writes to an externally defined path. If it writes to files directly, these are part of internal directories and can’t be modified externally.
*   Generated PDFs may have original image files embedded if the image was not altered via effects or blurs and the [`exportPdfWithHighCompatibility` option](nextjs/export-save-publish/export/overview-9ed3a8/) was **not** enabled. This means a malicious image file could theoretically be included in the exported PDF.
*   Inline text-editing allows arbitrary input of strings by users. The engine uses platform-specific default inputs and APIs and doesn’t apply additional sanitization. The acquired strings are stored and used exclusively for text rendering - they are neither executed nor used for file operations.

## Security Infrastructure[#](#security-infrastructure)

### Vulnerability Management[#](#vulnerability-management)

We take a proactive approach to security vulnerability management:

*   We use GitHub to track dependency vulnerabilities
*   We regularly update affected dependencies
*   We don’t maintain a private network, eliminating network vulnerability concerns in that context
*   We don’t manually maintain servers or infrastructure, as we don’t have live systems beyond those required for licensing
*   For storage and licensing, we use virtual instances in Google Cloud which are managed by the cloud provider
*   All security-related fixes are published in our public changelog at [https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/changelog/](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/changelog/)

### Security Development Practices[#](#security-development-practices)

Our development practices emphasize security:

*   We rely on established libraries with proven security track records
*   We don’t directly process sensitive user data in our code
*   Secrets (auth tokens, passwords, API credentials, certificates) are stored in GitHub or 1Password with granular access levels
*   We use RSA SHA256 encryption for our enterprise licenses
*   We rely on platform-standard SSL implementations for HTTPS communications

### API Key Management[#](#api-key-management)

API keys for CE.SDK are handled securely:

*   Keys are passed during instantiation and held in memory only
*   Keys are never stored permanently on client devices
*   For web implementation, keys are pinned to specific domains to prevent unauthorized use
*   Enterprise licenses use a file-based approach that doesn’t require API key validation

## Compliance[#](#compliance)

IMG.LY complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in all our operations, including CE.SDK. Our Privacy Policy is publicly available at [https://img.ly/privacy-policy](https://img.ly/privacy-policy).

Our client-side approach to content processing significantly reduces privacy and compliance concerns, as user content never leaves their device environment for processing.

## FAQ[#](#faq)

### Does CE.SDK upload my images or designs to IMG.LY servers?[#](#does-cesdk-upload-my-images-or-designs-to-imgly-servers)

No. CE.SDK processes all content locally on the user’s device. Your images, designs, and other content are never transmitted to IMG.LY servers.

### What data does IMG.LY collect through CE.SDK?[#](#what-data-does-imgly-collect-through-cesdk)

CE.SDK only collects device identifiers (such as identifierForVendor on iOS or ANDROID\_ID on Android) for licensing purposes and export counts. No user content or personal information is collected.

### How does IMG.LY protect API keys?[#](#how-does-imgly-protect-api-keys)

API keys are never stored permanently; they are held in memory during SDK operation. For web implementations, keys are pinned to specific domains to prevent unauthorized use.

### Has IMG.LY experienced any security breaches?[#](#has-imgly-experienced-any-security-breaches)

No, IMG.LY has not been involved in any cybersecurity breaches in the last 12 months.

### Does IMG.LY conduct security audits?[#](#does-imgly-conduct-security-audits)

As we don’t store customer data directly, but rely on third parties to do so, we focus our security efforts on dependency tracking and vulnerability management through GitHub’s security features. We don’t conduct security audits.

## Additional Information[#](#additional-information)

For more detailed information about our data collection practices, please refer to our Data Privacy and Retention information below.

Should you have any additional questions regarding security practices or require more information, please contact our team at [support@img.ly](mailto:support@img.ly).

## Data Privacy and Retention[#](#data-privacy-and-retention)

At IMG.LY, we prioritize your data privacy and ensure that apart from a minimal contractually stipulated set of interactions with our servers all other operations take place on your local device. Below is an overview of our data privacy and retention policies:

### **Data Processing**[#](#data-processing)

All data processed by CE.SDK remains strictly on your device. We do not transfer your data to our servers for processing. This means that operations such as rendering, editing, and other in-app functionalities happen entirely locally, ensuring that sensitive project or personal data stays with you.

### **Data Retention**[#](#data-retention)

We do not store any project-related data on our servers. Since all data operations occur locally, no information about your edits, images, or video content is retained by CE.SDK. The only data that interacts with our servers is related to license validation and telemetry related to usage tied to your pricing plan.

### **License Validation**[#](#license-validation)

CE.SDK performs a license validation check with our servers once upon initialization to validate the software license being used. This interaction is minimal and does not involve the transfer of any personal, project, or media data.

### **Event Tracking**[#](#event-tracking)

While CE.SDK does not track user actions other than the exceptions listed below through telemetry or analytics by default, there are specific events tracked to manage customer usage, particularly for API key usage tracking. We gather the following information during these events:

*   **When the engine loads:** App identifier, platform, engine version, user ID (provided by the client), device ID (mobile only), and session ID.
*   **When a photo or video is exported:** User ID, device ID, session ID, media type (photo/video), resolution (width and height), FPS (video only), and duration (video only).

This tracking is solely for ensuring accurate usage calculation and managing monthly active user billing. Enterprise clients can opt out of this tracking under specific agreements.

### **Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**[#](#personal-identifiable-information-pii)

The only PII that is potentially collected includes device-specific identifiers such as `identifierForVendor` on iOS and `ANDROID_ID` on Android. These IDs are used for tracking purposes and are reset when the user reinstalls the app or resets the device. No consent is required for these identifiers because they are crucial for our usage-based pricing models. This is covered by the GDPR as legitimate interest.

### **User Consent**[#](#user-consent)

As mentioned above, user consent is not required when solely using the CE.SDK. However, this may change depending on the specific enterprise agreement or additional regulatory requirements. IMG.LY is committed to maintaining compliance with **GDPR** and other applicable data protection laws, ensuring your privacy is respected at all times. For details consult our [privacy policy](https://img.ly/privacy-policy).

# Improve Performance

Code Splitting

```
// When using node modulues in a bundler:async function loadCreativeEngine() {  const module = await import('@cesdk/engine');  const CreativeEngine = module.default;  return CreativeEngine;}
// When loading the engine module directly from the CDN:async function loadCreativeEngine() {  const module = await import(    'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/index.js'  );  const CreativeEngine = module.default;  return CreativeEngine;}
```

### Code Splitting[#](#code-splitting)

Keep in mind that the CreativeEngine bundle has a substantial size. Depending on your use case, it might make sense to delay loading of the module, using a dynamic import statement:

Consult your bundler’s documentation for more information:

*   [Code Splitting | Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)
*   [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#code-splitting)
*   [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/features/code-splitting/)

```
// When using node modulues in a bundler:async function loadCreativeEngine() {  const module = await import('@cesdk/engine');  const CreativeEngine = module.default;  return CreativeEngine;}
```

You can also make use of code splitting in the browser, without a bundler. It works in the same way, but you would load our code from the CDN.

```
// When loading the engine module directly from the CDN:async function loadCreativeEngine() {  const module = await import(    'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/index.js'  );  const CreativeEngine = module.default;  return CreativeEngine;}
```

# LLMs.txt

Our documentation is now available in LLMs.txt format, optimized for AI reasoning engines. To better support platform-specific development, we’ve created separate documentation files for each platform.

For Next.js developers, this means you can now access documentation tailored to your specific platform, whether it’s iOS, Android, Web, or any other supported platform. This approach allows for a more focused and efficient use of AI tools in your development workflow.

[

Download /nextjs/llms-full.txt

](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/nextjs/llms-full.txt)

These documentation files are substantial in size, with token counts exceeding the context windows of many AI models. This guide explains how to download and effectively use these platform-specific documentation files with AI tools to accelerate your development process.

## What are LLMs.txt files?[#](#what-are-llmstxt-files)

LLMs.txt is an emerging standard for making documentation AI-friendly. Unlike traditional documentation formats, LLMs.txt:

*   Presents content in a clean, markdown-based format
*   Eliminates extraneous HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
*   Optimizes content for AI context windows
*   Provides a comprehensive view of documentation in a single file

By using our platform-specific LLMs.txt files, you’ll ensure that AI tools have the most relevant and complete context for helping with your development tasks.

## Handling Large Documentation Files[#](#handling-large-documentation-files)

Due to the size of our documentation files (upward of 500 000 tokens) most AI tools will face context window limitations. Standard models typically have context windows ranging from 8,000 to 200,000 tokens, making it challenging to process our complete documentation in a single session.

### Recommended AI Model for Full Documentation[#](#recommended-ai-model-for-full-documentation)

For working with our complete documentation files, we recommend:

*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Available via Google AI Studio with a context window of 1-2 million tokens, capable of handling even our largest documentation file

# Key Concepts

CE.SDK is built on two distinct technical layers that work together seamlessly:

*   [User Interface](nextjs/user-interface-5a089a/)
*   [Engine Interface](nextjs/engine-interface-6fb7cf/)

![The different layers CE.SDK is made of, see description below.](/docs/cesdk/_astro/layers._NZlSdtG_Zyol2N.webp)

This intentional separation gives you powerful advantages:

1.  **Cross-platform consistency** – The engine is cross-compiled to native web, iOS, Android, and Node.js, ensuring identical output everywhere
2.  **Custom UI** – Build your own UI for simpler tools and workflows
3.  **Headless automation** – Run the engine independently for automations and batch processing, both client-side and server-side

## Creative Engine[#](#creative-engine)

The Creative Engine powers all core editing operations. It handles rendering, processing, and manipulation across images, layouts, text, video, audio, and vectors.

**What the Engine Does:**

*   Maintains the scene file (your structured content)
*   Renders the canvas in real-time
*   Handles block positioning and resizing
*   Applies filters and effects to images
*   Manages text editing and typography
*   Controls templates with role-based permissions
*   Displays smart guides and snap lines

Every engine capability is exposed through a comprehensive API, letting you build custom UIs, workflows, and automations.

## Headless / Engine only[#](#headless--engine-only)

Use the engine without any UI for powerful automation scenarios:

**Client-side automation** Perfect for in-browser batch operations and dynamic content generation without server dependencies.

**Server-side automation with Node.js** Use the [Node.JS SDK](node/what-is-cesdk-2e7acd/) for following scenarios:

*   **High-resolution processing** – Edit on the client with preview quality, then render server-side with full-resolution assets
*   **Bulk generation** – Create a large volume of design variations for variable data printing
*   **Non-blocking workflows** – Let users continue designing while exports process in the background

**Plugin development** When building [CE.SDK plugins](nextjs/user-interface/ui-extensions-d194d1/), you get direct API access to manipulate canvas elements programmatically.

## User Interface Components[#](#user-interface-components)

CE.SDK includes pre-built UI configurations optimized for different use cases:

*   [Photo editing](nextjs/prebuilt-solutions/photo-editor-42ccb2/)
*   Video editing
*   [Design editing](nextjs/prebuilt-solutions/design-editor-9bf041/) (similar to Canva)
*   2D product design ([apparel](nextjs/prebuilt-solutions/t-shirt-designer-02b48f/), [postcards](nextjs/prebuilt-solutions/postcard-editor-61e1f6/), etc.)

More configurations are coming based on customer needs.

## UI Customization[#](#ui-customization)

While UI configurations provide a solid foundation, you maintain control over the user experience:

*   Apply [custom color schemes](nextjs/user-interface/customization/color-palette-429fd9/) and branding
*   Enable or disable [specific features](nextjs/user-interface/customization/disable-or-enable-f058e2/)
*   Add [custom asset libraries](nextjs/import-media/asset-library-65d6c4/) (fonts, images, graphics, videos, audio)
*   Extend functionality through the [plugin system](nextjs/user-interface/ui-extensions-d194d1/) (e.g. adding [AI features](nextjs/prebuilt-solutions/ai-editor-5409b9/), custom workflows, etc)

The plugin architecture lets you add custom buttons and panels throughout the interface, ensuring the editor feels native to your product.

# Engine Interface

The Creative Engine is the powerhouse behind CE.SDK’s cross-platform capabilities. While the UI components provide ready-to-use editing experiences, the Engine interface gives you direct programmatic control over all creative operations—from simple batch processing to complex automated workflows.

## Client-Side vs Server-Side Processing[#](#client-side-vs-server-side-processing)

Understanding when to use client-side versus server-side processing is crucial for building efficient creative automation workflows. Each approach offers distinct advantages depending on your use case requirements.

### Client-Side Processing (Browser / Mobile Device)[#](#client-side-processing-browser--mobile-device)

Client-side processing runs the Engine directly in the user’s client — but importantly, this doesn’t mean visible to the user. The Engine operates headlessly in the background, making it perfect for automation tasks that enhance user experience without interrupting their workflow.

**Common Implementation Patterns:**

**Hidden Engine Instances**: Run a second, invisible Engine instance alongside your main UI for background processing. While users edit in the primary interface, the hidden instance can validate designs, generate previews, or prepare export-ready assets.

```
// Hidden engine for background automationconst backgroundEngine = await CreativeEngine.init({  container: null, // Headless - no UI container  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',});
// Use background engine for validation while user continues editingasync function validateDesignInBackground(sceneData) {  await backgroundEngine.scene.loadFromString(sceneData);  const issues = await runDesignValidation(backgroundEngine);  return issues;}
```

**Underlying Engine Access**: Access the Engine API directly from prebuilt UI components for custom automation within existing workflows.

**Dedicated Engine Packages**: Use platform-specific Engine packages (Web, iOS, Android) for specialized client-side automation without any UI overhead.

**Ideal Client-Side Use Cases:**

*   **Design Validation**: Check for empty placeholders, low-resolution images, or brand guideline violations in real-time
*   **Thumbnail Generation**: Create preview images for design galleries or version history
*   **Effect Previews**: Generate quick previews of filters or effects before applying them to the main design
*   **Auto-Save Optimization**: Compress and optimize scenes for storage while maintaining editability
*   **Real-Time Feedback**: Provide instant visual feedback for design rules or constraints

```
// Example: Real-time thumbnail generationconst thumbnailEngine = await CreativeEngine.init({ container: null });
async function generateThumbnail(sceneData) {  await thumbnailEngine.scene.loadFromString(sceneData);  const page = thumbnailEngine.scene.getPages()[0];
  // Generate small preview  const thumbnail = await thumbnailEngine.block.export(page, 'image/jpeg', {    targetWidth: 200,    targetHeight: 200,    quality: 0.7,  });
  return thumbnail;}
// Use during design process for gallery viewsdesignHistory.forEach(async version => {  const thumb = await generateThumbnail(version.sceneData);  updateGalleryThumbnail(version.id, thumb);});
```

### Server-Side Processing (Node.js)[#](#server-side-processing-nodejs)

Server-side processing using our [Node.JS SDK](node/what-is-cesdk-2e7acd/) moves the Engine to your backend infrastructure, unlocking powerful capabilities for resource-intensive operations and scalable workflows.

**Key Advantages:**

*   **Enhanced Resources**: Access to more CPU, memory, and storage than client devices
*   **Parallelizable Workflows**: Run multiple Engine instances simultaneously for bulk processing
*   **Secure Asset Access**: Process private assets without exposing them to client-side code
*   **Background Operations**: Handle long-running tasks without affecting user experience
*   **Scheduled Automation**: Trigger design generation based on events, schedules, or external APIs

**Ideal Server-Side Use Cases:**

*   **High-Resolution Exports**: Generate print-quality assets that would be too resource-intensive for client devices
*   **Bulk Generation**: Create thousands of design variations for marketing campaigns or product catalogs
*   **Data Pipeline Integration**: Connect to databases, APIs, or file systems for automated content generation
*   **Multi-Format Output**: Export designs in multiple formats and resolutions simultaneously
*   **Workflow Orchestration**: Coordinate complex multi-step automation processes

**Hybrid Workflows**: Often, the most effective approach combines both client and server-side processing. Users can design and preview on the client with instant feedback, while heavy processing happens on the server in the background.

## Engine-Powered Use Cases[#](#engine-powered-use-cases)

The Engine interface unlocks powerful automation scenarios that can scale creative workflows:

### Batch Processing[#](#batch-processing)

Process multiple designs simultaneously with consistent results. Whether you’re applying filters to hundreds of images or generating variations of a marketing template, the Engine handles bulk operations efficiently both client-side and server-side.

```
// Example: Batch apply filters to multiple imagesfor (const imageData of imageCollection) {  const page = engine.scene.createPage();  const image = engine.block.create('image');  engine.block.setString(image, 'image/imageFileURI', imageData.url);
  // Apply consistent filters  const filter = engine.block.createEffect('filter');  engine.block.appendChild(image, filter);
  // Export processed result  const result = await engine.block.export(page, 'image/png');}
```

### Auto-Resize[#](#auto-resize)

Automatically adapt designs to different aspect ratios and platforms. The Engine intelligently repositions elements, adjusts text sizes, and maintains visual hierarchy across formats—from Instagram stories to LinkedIn posts.

### Data Merge[#](#data-merge)

Connect external data sources (CSV, JSON, APIs) to templates for personalized content generation. Perfect for creating thousands of product cards, personalized certificates, or location-specific campaigns.

```
// Example: Merge product data into templateconst productData = await fetch('/api/products').then(r => r.json());
for (const product of productData) {  // Load template  const scene = await engine.scene.loadFromURL('/templates/product-card.scene');
  // Replace placeholder content  engine.block.setString(titleBlock, 'text/text', product.name);  engine.block.setString(priceBlock, 'text/text', `$${product.price}`);  engine.block.setString(imageBlock, 'image/imageFileURI', product.imageUrl);
  // Export personalized design  const output = await engine.block.export(page, 'image/png');}
```

### Product Variations[#](#product-variations)

Generate multiple versions of product designs with different colors, sizes, or configurations. Ideal for e-commerce platforms needing to showcase product options without manual design work.

### Design Generation[#](#design-generation)

Create entirely new designs programmatically based on rules, templates, or AI inputs. The Engine can compose layouts, select appropriate fonts, and arrange elements according to your design guidelines. See the [full guide](nextjs/automation/design-generation-98a99e/) for details.

### Multiple Image Generation[#](#multiple-image-generation)

Efficiently process and export designs in various formats and resolutions. Generate web-optimized previews alongside print-ready high-resolution files in a single workflow.

### Actions[#](#actions)

Implement complex multi-step operations as reusable actions. Chain together filters, transformations, and exports to create sophisticated automated workflows that can be triggered programmatically.

# Configuration

The CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) works out of the box with almost zero configuration effort. However, almost every part of CE.SDK can be adapted and its behaviour and look & feel changed.

Here is a list of all available configuration options:

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| baseURL | `string` | Definition of the the base URL of all assets required by the SDK. |
| callbacks | `object` | **Deprecated** - Use `cesdk.actions.register()` API after initialization. Legacy callback configuration for SDK triggers. |
| i18n | `object` | **Deprecated** - Use `cesdk.i18n.setTranslations()` instead. Options to add custom translations to the SDK. |
| license | `string` | A license key that is unique to your product. Without a license, a watermark is shown on exports. Get one at [https://img.ly/forms/free-trial](https://img.ly/forms/free-trial) to remove the watermark. |
| userID | `string` | An unique ID tied to your application’s user. This helps us accurately calculate monthly active users (MAU). Especially useful when one person uses the app on multiple devices with a sign-in feature, ensuring they’re counted once. Providing this aids in better data accuracy. |
| locale | `string` | **Deprecated** - Use `cesdk.i18n.setLocale()` instead. Chosen language the editor uses. Possible values are ‘en’, ‘de’, … |
| role | `string` | Chosen role. Possible values are ‘Creator’ or ‘Adopter’. |
| theme | `string` | **Deprecated** - Use `cesdk.ui.setTheme()` instead. The preferred theme the SDK is launched with. Possible values are ‘system’, ‘dark’, ‘light’. Default is ‘light’. |
| ui | `object` | Options to adapt the user interface elements. |

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY', // Optional - removes watermark from exports  userId: 'USER_ID',  baseURL: 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/assets',  role: 'Creator', // 'Adopter' 'Viewer'  logger: (message, logLevel) => {    console.log(`${logLevel}: ${message}}`);  },};
CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk_container', config).then(async cesdk => {  // Set theme using the UI API  cesdk.ui.setTheme('dark'); // 'system', 'dark', or 'light'
  // Get the current theme  const currentTheme = cesdk.ui.getTheme(); // Returns 'light' or 'dark'
  cesdk.i18n.setLocale('en'); // 'de'
  // Populate the asset library with default / demo asset sources.  cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();  cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({    sceneMode: 'Design',    withUploadAssetSources: true,  });
  await cesdk.createDesignScene();
  // Theme can be changed at runtime  // cesdk.ui.setTheme('light');});
```

# Compatibility & Security

CE.SDK provides robust compatibility and security features across platforms. Learn about supported browsers, frameworks, file formats, language support, and how CE.SDK ensures secure operation in your applications.

---



[Source](https:/img.ly/docs/cesdk/nextjs/compatibility-139ef9)

# System Compatibility

CE.SDK runs entirely on clients and makes use of hardware acceleration provided within that environment. Therefore, the user’s hardware always acts as an upper bound of what’s achievable.

The editor’s performance scales with scene complexity. We generally found scenes with up to 200 blocks well usable, but complex blocks like auto-sizing text or high-resolution image fills may affect performance negatively. This is always constrained by the processing power available on the user’s device, so for low-end devices, the experience may suffer earlier. Therefore, it’s generally desirable to keep scenes only as complex as needed.

## Hardware Limitations[#](#hardware-limitations)

Each device has a limited amount of high performance hardware decoders and encoders. If the maximum number is reached it will fall back to (slow) software de- and encoding. Therefore users may encounter slow export performance when trying to export in parallel with other software that utilizes encoders and decoders, e.g. Zoom, Teams or video content in other tabs / apps. This, unfortunately, is a limitation of hardware, operating system and browser and cannot be solved.

## Recommended Hardware[#](#recommended-hardware)

| Platform | Hardware |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop | A notebook or desktop released in the last 7 years and at least 4GB of memory. |
| Mobile (Apple) | iPhone 8, iPad (6th gen) or newer |
| Mobile (Android) | Phones & tablets released in the last 4 years |

## Video[#](#video)

Our video feature introduces additional requirements and we generally distinguish playback (decoding) and export (encoding) capabilities. On the web, certain browser features directly depend on the host operating system. For video, this currently introduces the following limitations:

*   Transparency in H.265 videos is **not supported** on Windows hosts.
*   **Chrome on Linux** generally doesn’t ship with encoder support for H.264 & AAC, which can cause video exports to fail even though decoding of non-free codecs is supported.
*   **Chromium** although technically the base of Chrome doesn’t include any codecs for licensing reasons and therefore can’t be used for video editing. It does fall back to system-provided media libraries on e.g. macOS, but support is not guaranteed in any way.
*   Video is **not supported** on mobile browsers on any platform due to technical limitations which result in performance issues.

## Export Limitations[#](#export-limitations)

The export size is limited by the hardware capabilities of the device, e.g., due to the maximum texture size that can be allocated. The maximum possible export size can be queried via API, see [export guide](nextjs/export-save-publish/export/overview-9ed3a8/).

[Source](https:/img.ly/docs/cesdk/nextjs/browser-support-28c1b0)

# Browser Support

The CreativeEditor SDK requires specific APIs to fully function. For video-related features, the required APIs are only supported in certain browsers. As a result, the list of supported browsers is currently limited to the following:

| Supported Browser | Graphics Editing | Video Editing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | **114** or newer | **114** or newer |
| Chrome Android | **114** or newer | not supported |
| Chrome iOS | **114** or newer (on iOS/iPadOS 15 or newer) | not supported |
| Edge | **114** or newer | **114** or newer |
| Firefox | **115** or newer | not supported |
| Safari | **15.6** or newer | **26.0** or newer |
| Safari iOS | **15.6** or newer (on iOS/iPadOS 15 or newer) | not supported |

For our video features, unsupported browsers will display a warning dialog informing about them not supported when they are being used to access CE.SDK video functionality.

While other browsers based on the Chromium project might work fine (Arc, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi etc.) they are not officially supported.

## Host Platform Restrictions[#](#host-platform-restrictions)

All supported browsers rely on the host’s platform APIs for different kind of functionality (e.g. video support). Check our [known editor limitations](nextjs/compatibility-139ef9/) for more details on these.

# Actions API

The Actions API provides a centralized way to manage and customize actions for various user interactions in CE.SDK.

The Actions API is available after CE.SDK initialization through `cesdk.actions`.

CE.SDK also provides a Utils API (`cesdk.utils`) with utility functions for common operations like exporting, file handling, and UI dialogs. These utilities can be used directly or within your custom actions.

## API Methods[#](#api-methods)

The Actions API provides four methods:

*   `register(actionId, handler)` - Register an action function for a specific event
*   `get(actionId)` - Retrieve a registered action function
*   `run(actionId, ...args)` - Execute a registered action with the provided arguments (throws if not registered)
*   `list(matcher)` - Lists registered action IDs, optionally filtered by wildcard pattern

## Getting Started[#](#getting-started)

Register actions after initializing CE.SDK:

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from '@cesdk/cesdk-js';
const cesdk = await CreativeEditorSDK.create(container, {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',});
// Register an actioncesdk.actions.register('actionType', async (...args) => {  // Your custom implementation  return result;});
// Execute a registered actionawait cesdk.actions.run('actionType', arg1, arg2);
// Or retrieve an action to call it laterconst action = cesdk.actions.get('actionType');
// List all registered actionsconst allActions = cesdk.actions.list();
// List actions matching a patternconst exportActions = cesdk.actions.list({ matcher: 'export*' });
```

## Default Actions[#](#default-actions)

CE.SDK automatically registers the following default actions:

### Action Handlers[#](#action-handlers)

*   `saveScene` - Saves the current scene (default: downloads scene file)
*   `shareScene` - Shares the current scene (no default implementation)
*   `exportDesign` - Exports design in various formats (default: downloads the exported file)
*   `importScene` - Imports scene or archive files (default: opens file picker)
*   `exportScene` - Exports scene or archive (default: downloads the file)
*   `uploadFile` - Uploads files to asset sources (default: local upload for development)
*   `onUnsupportedBrowser` - Handles unsupported browsers (no default implementation)

The `shareScene` and `onUnsupportedBrowser` actions do not have default implementations and must be registered manually.

CE.SDK provides both an Actions API for handling user actions and a Utils API for utility functions. See the Utils API section below for details on available utilities.

### Scene Management Actions[#](#scene-management-actions)

#### `saveScene`[#](#savescene)

Handles saving the current scene. Default implementation downloads the scene file.

```
// Basic implementationcesdk.actions.register('saveScene', async () => {  const scene = await cesdk.engine.scene.saveToString();  console.log('Scene saved:', scene.length, 'characters');
  // Production:  // await yourAPI.saveScene(scene);
  cesdk.ui.showNotification('Scene saved successfully');});
// With loading dialogcesdk.actions.register('saveScene', async () => {  const dialogController = cesdk.utils.showLoadingDialog({    title: 'Saving Scene',    message: 'Please wait...',    progress: 'indeterminate',  });
  try {    const scene = await cesdk.engine.scene.saveToString();    console.log('Scene saved:', scene.length, 'characters');
    // Production:    // await yourAPI.saveScene(scene);
    dialogController.showSuccess({      title: 'Saved',      message: 'Scene saved successfully',    });  } catch (error) {    dialogController.showError({      title: 'Save Failed',      message: 'Could not save the scene',    });    throw error;  }});
```

#### `shareScene`[#](#sharescene)

Handles scene sharing. No default implementation.

```
// Register share functionalitycesdk.actions.register('shareScene', async () => {  const scene = await cesdk.engine.scene.saveToString();  const shareUrl = 'https://example.com/shared-scene-placeholder';  console.log('Scene ready to share:', scene.length, 'characters');
  // Production:  // const shareUrl = await yourAPI.createShareableLink(scene);
  await navigator.share({ url: shareUrl });});
```

#### `importScene` and `exportScene`[#](#importscene-and-exportscene)

Handle scene import/export operations with support for both scene files and archives.

```
// Import scene or archivecesdk.actions.register('importScene', async ({ format }) => {  if (format === 'archive') {    console.log('Archive import requested');
    // Production:    // const archive = await yourAPI.loadArchive();    // await cesdk.engine.scene.loadFromArchiveURL(archive);  } else {    console.log('Scene import requested');
    // Production:    // const scene = await yourAPI.loadScene();    // await cesdk.engine.scene.loadFromString(scene);  }});
// Export scene or archivecesdk.actions.register('exportScene', async ({ format }) => {  if (format === 'archive') {    const archive = await cesdk.engine.scene.saveToArchive();    console.log('Archive ready for export:', archive.length, 'bytes');
    // Production:    // await yourAPI.uploadArchive(archive);  } else {    const scene = await cesdk.engine.scene.saveToString();    console.log('Scene ready for export:', scene.length, 'characters');
    // Production:    // await yourAPI.uploadScene(scene);  }});
```

### Export Operations[#](#export-operations)

#### `exportDesign`[#](#exportdesign)

Handles all export operations (images, PDFs, videos). Default implementation downloads the exported file.

```
// Basic implementationcesdk.actions.register('exportDesign', async options => {  // Use the utils API to perform the export with loading dialog  const { blobs, options: exportOptions } = await cesdk.utils.export(options);  console.log('Exported', blobs.length, 'files');  blobs.forEach((blob, i) => console.log(`File ${i + 1}:`, blob.size, 'bytes'));
  // Production:  // await Promise.all(blobs.map(blob => yourCDN.upload(blob)));
  cesdk.ui.showNotification('Export completed successfully');});
// Direct engine export with custom loading dialog (bypassing utils)cesdk.actions.register('exportDesign', async options => {  const dialogController = cesdk.utils.showLoadingDialog({    title: 'Exporting',    message: 'Processing your export...',  });
  try {    const page = cesdk.engine.scene.getCurrentPage();    if (page === null) {      throw new Error('No page selected for export');    }    let result;
    if (options?.mimeType?.startsWith('video/')) {      // Video export with progress      result = await cesdk.engine.block.exportVideo(page, {        ...options,        onProgress: (rendered, encoded, total) => {          dialogController.updateProgress({            value: rendered,            max: total,          });        },      });    } else {      // Static export (image/PDF)      result = await cesdk.engine.block.export(page, options);    }
    console.log('File ready for export:', result.size, 'bytes');
    // Production:    // await yourCDN.upload(result);
    dialogController.showSuccess({      title: 'Export Complete',      message: 'Files uploaded successfully',    });  } catch (error) {    dialogController.showError({      title: 'Export Failed',      message: 'Could not complete the export',    });    throw error;  }});
```

### File Upload Action[#](#file-upload-action)

#### `uploadFile`[#](#uploadfile)

Handles file uploads to asset sources. Default implementation uses local upload for development.

```
// Register production upload handlercesdk.actions.register('uploadFile', async (file, onProgress, context) => {  console.log('Uploading file:', file.name, file.size, 'bytes');  onProgress(50); // Simulate progress  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));  onProgress(100);
  // Production:  // const asset = await yourStorageService.upload(file, {  //   onProgress: (percent) => onProgress(percent),  //   context  // });
  // Return AssetDefinition  return {    id: 'local-' + Date.now(),    label: { en: file.name },    meta: {      uri: URL.createObjectURL(file),      thumbUri: URL.createObjectURL(file),      kind: 'image',      width: 1920,      height: 1080,      // Production:      // uri: asset.url,      // thumbUri: asset.thumbnailUrl,      // width: asset.width,      // height: asset.height    },  };});
```

You can control which file types users can upload by setting the `upload/supportedMimeTypes` setting:

```
// Example 1: Only allow imagescesdk.engine.editor.setSettingString(  'upload/supportedMimeTypes',  'image/png,image/jpeg,image/gif,image/svg+xml',);
// Example 2: Allow images and videoscesdk.engine.editor.setSettingString(  'upload/supportedMimeTypes',  'image/png,image/jpeg,image/gif,video/mp4,video/quicktime',);
// Example 3: Allow specific document typescesdk.engine.editor.setSettingString(  'upload/supportedMimeTypes',  'application/pdf,image/png,image/jpeg',);
```

The default `uploadFile` implementation uses local upload for development only. Always register a proper upload handler for production.

### Unsupported Browser Action[#](#unsupported-browser-action)

#### `onUnsupportedBrowser`[#](#onunsupportedbrowser)

Handles unsupported browser detection. No default implementation is provided.

```
// Register handler for unsupported browserscesdk.actions.register('onUnsupportedBrowser', () => {  // Redirect to a custom compatibility page  window.location.href = '/browser-not-supported';});
```

## Utils API[#](#utils-api)

CE.SDK provides a Utils API with utility functions for common operations. These utilities are available through `cesdk.utils`:

### Loading Dialogs[#](#loading-dialogs)

```
// Create and manage loading dialogsconst dialogController = cesdk.utils.showLoadingDialog({  title: 'Processing...',  message: 'Please wait', // Can also be an array of strings  progress: 0, // Initial progress value or 'indeterminate'  cancelLabel: 'Cancel',  abortTitle: 'Abort Operation?',  abortMessage: 'Are you sure you want to abort?',  abortLabel: 'Abort',  size: 'large', // 'regular' or 'large'  clickOutsideToClose: false,  onAbort: () => console.log('User cancelled'),  onDone: () => console.log('Dialog closed'),});
// Update progressdialogController.updateProgress({ value: 50, max: 100 });
// Show success or errordialogController.showSuccess({  title: 'Done!',  message: 'Operation completed',});dialogController.showError({ title: 'Error', message: 'Something went wrong' });
// Close dialogdialogController.close();
```

### Export Utility[#](#export-utility)

The export utility automatically handles both static (images, PDFs) and video exports:

```
// Export image or PDFconst { blobs, options } = await cesdk.utils.export({  mimeType: 'image/png',  pngCompressionLevel: 7,});
// Export video (automatically detected by MIME type)const { blobs, options } = await cesdk.utils.export({  mimeType: 'video/mp4',  onProgress: (rendered, encoded, total) => {    console.log(`Progress: ${rendered}/${total} frames`);  },});
```

### File Operations[#](#file-operations)

```
// Load file from userconst file = await cesdk.utils.loadFile({  accept: 'image/*',  returnType: 'File', // 'dataURL', 'text', 'blob', 'arrayBuffer', or 'File'});
// Download file to user's deviceawait cesdk.utils.downloadFile(blob, 'image/png');
// Local upload (development only)const asset = await cesdk.utils.localUpload(file, context);
```

## Implementation Examples[#](#implementation-examples)

### Environment-Based Upload Strategy[#](#environment-based-upload-strategy)

```
// Use local upload in development, CDN in productioncesdk.actions.register('uploadFile', async (file, onProgress, context) => {  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {    // Use utils for local upload    return await cesdk.utils.localUpload(file, context);  } else {    console.log('Production upload for:', file.name);    onProgress(100);
    // Production:    // const asset = await yourCDNService.upload(file, {    //   onProgress: onProgress    // });
    return {      id: 'prod-' + Date.now(),      label: { en: file.name },      meta: {        uri: URL.createObjectURL(file),        thumbUri: URL.createObjectURL(file),        // Production:        // uri: asset.url,        // thumbUri: asset.thumbnailUrl      },    };  }});
```

### Combining Utils with Custom Logic[#](#combining-utils-with-custom-logic)

```
// Use utils for heavy lifting, add custom business logiccesdk.actions.register('exportDesign', async options => {  console.log('Export started:', { format: options?.mimeType });
  // Production:  // analytics.track('export_started', { format: options?.mimeType });
  // Use utils to handle the export with loading dialog  const { blobs, options: exportOptions } = await cesdk.utils.export(options);
  // Custom post-processing  if (exportOptions.mimeType === 'application/pdf') {    console.log('PDF ready for watermarking:', blobs[0].size, 'bytes');
    // Production:    // const watermarkedBlob = await addWatermark(blobs[0]);    // await cesdk.utils.downloadFile(watermarkedBlob, 'application/pdf');
    await cesdk.utils.downloadFile(blobs[0], 'application/pdf');  } else {    // Direct download for other formats    await cesdk.utils.downloadFile(blobs[0], exportOptions.mimeType);  }
  console.log('Export completed:', { format: exportOptions.mimeType });
  // Production:  // analytics.track('export_completed', { format: exportOptions.mimeType });});
```

## Registering Custom Actions with Custom IDs[#](#registering-custom-actions-with-custom-ids)

Beyond the predefined action types, you can register actions with custom IDs for your own application-specific needs:

```
// Register a custom actioncesdk.actions.register('myCustomAction', async data => {  console.log('Custom action triggered with:', data);  return { success: true, processedData: data };});
// Execute the custom action using runconst result = await cesdk.actions.run('myCustomAction', { someData: 'value' });
// Or retrieve it for conditional executionconst customAction = cesdk.actions.get('myCustomAction');if (customAction) {  const result = await customAction({ someData: 'value' });}
```

## Discovering Registered Actions[#](#discovering-registered-actions)

Use `list()` to get all registered action IDs or find actions matching a pattern:

```
// Get all registered action IDsconst registeredActions = cesdk.actions.list();console.log('Available actions:', registeredActions);
// Find actions matching a patternconst exportActions = cesdk.actions.list({ matcher: 'export*' });console.log('Export actions:', exportActions);
```

## Using Actions with Navigation Actions[#](#using-actions-with-navigation-actions)

The navigation bar actions in CE.SDK automatically use the registered actions:

### Default Navigation Bar Actions[#](#default-navigation-bar-actions)

The default navigation bar actions map to actions:

*   Save action → `saveScene` action
*   Share action → `shareScene` action
*   Export actions → `exportDesign` action
*   Import scene/archive → `importScene` action
*   Export scene/archive → `exportScene` action

# Overview

The CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) includes a powerful, fully-integrated user interface that enables your users to create, edit, and export stunning designs—without requiring you to build a UI from scratch. Whether you’re launching a full-featured editor or embedding design tools into a larger application, CE.SDK provides everything you need to get started quickly.

Out of the box, the UI is professional, responsive, and production-ready. But it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. You can fully **customize**, **extend**, or even **replace the UI entirely** with your own interface built on top of the CE.SDK engine. The SDK is designed to be as flexible as your product demands.

[Launch Web Demo](https://img.ly/showcases/cesdk)[

Get Started

](nextjs/get-started/overview-e18f40/)

## Architecture[#](#architecture)

CE.SDK’s UI is modular, declaratively configured, and tightly integrated with the core engine. At a high level, it consists of:

*   **Core Engine APIs** — The underlying logic for manipulating scenes, blocks, assets, and rendering
*   **UI Components** — Panels, bars, buttons, and menus that interact with the engine through configuration and callbacks
*   **Event System** — A reactive layer that tracks user input, selections, and state transitions

This separation of concerns allows you to extend, replace, or completely rebuild the UI without impacting the rendering and scene logic handled by the engine.

## Default UI[#](#default-ui)

When you initialize CE.SDK in your project, it includes a preconfigured interface with all the essential components you need:

![Locations of the web editor](/docs/cesdk/_astro/Editor_locations.CcyFIZYZ_2g7sWP.webp)

### Canvas[#](#canvas)

The canvas is the main area of the editor where the user interacts with design content. This part is completely controlled by the Creative Engine. It is basically the core of CE.SDK and the web editor is build around it. This is also the part you need to interact with if you want to create a complete custom UI and not use the web editor.

### Dock[#](#dock)

The dock is the main entry point for user interactions not directly related to the currently selected block. It occupies a prominent place in the editor and is primarily, though not exclusively, used to open panels with asset libraries. Therefore, the default and recommended position of the asset library panel is on the side of the dock. However, depending on the use case, it might be beneficial to add other buttons and functionalities (even block-specific ones) to highlight them due to the prominence of the dock.

![Dock](/docs/cesdk/_astro/dock.CngvEV_7_8kJG4.webp)

### Canvas Menu[#](#canvas-menu)

For every selected block on the canvas, the canvas menu appears either above or below the frame of the selected block. This menu provides the most important block-specific actions and settings, ensuring they are immediately visible to the user. It is recommended to add as few elements as possible to the canvas menu to keep it clean and focused.

![Cavnas Menu](/docs/cesdk/_astro/canvas-menu.BdsyHoTA_ZViNeF.webp)

### Inspector Bar[#](#inspector-bar)

The main location for block-specific functionality is the inspector bar. Any action or setting available to the user for the currently selected block that does not appear in the canvas menu should be added here.

![Inspector Bar](/docs/cesdk/_astro/inspector-bar.ykmLzt2p_ZIAr8g.webp)

### Navigation Bar[#](#navigation-bar)

Actions that affect browser navigation (e.g. going back or closing the editor), have global effects on the scene (e.g. undo/redo and zoom), or process the scene in some way (e.g. saving and exporting) should be placed in the navigation bar.

![Navigation Bar](/docs/cesdk/_astro/navigation-bar.BkGdp7RR_Z13LvSk.webp)

### Canvas Bar[#](#canvas-bar)

The canvas bar is intended for actions that affect the canvas or scene as a whole. Undo/redo or zoom controls can be placed here as an alternative to the navigation bar.

![Canvas Bar](/docs/cesdk/_astro/canvas-bar.BzCOlC4s_ZEqqML.webp)

Each of these elements can be customized, removed, rearranged, or extended using the SDK’s UI configuration and plugin APIs.

### Panel[#](#panel)

Panels are flexible UI containers designed to support more advanced and interactive functionality within the editor. Unlike quick actions, which focus on single-click operations, panels give you the space and flexibility to build full user interfaces around complex workflows. You can use panels to:

#### Walk Users Through Workflows[#](#walk-users-through-workflows)

Use panels to guide users step by step through a process—whether it’s customizing a template, setting up a product variation, or configuring export settings. Panels help ensure clarity and structure in more involved tasks.

#### Connect with External APIs or AI Services[#](#connect-with-external-apis-or-ai-services)

While quick actions are great for simple integrations, some features—like AI-powered design generation or third-party content retrieval—require user input or multi-step interaction. Panels let you build richer interfaces that connect with external services and present results directly in the editor.

#### Gather Detailed User Input[#](#gather-detailed-user-input)

Panels are ideal for collecting structured input, such as text, color choices, image uploads, or toggle options. You can use them to power advanced use cases like custom theming, batch updates, or conditional logic based on user selections.

## Customizing the UI[#](#customizing-the-ui)

You can tailor the editor’s interface to match your brand and use case. CE.SDK provides flexible APIs and configuration options for customizing:

### Appearance[#](#appearance)

*   Change the UI theme or colors
*   Use custom fonts and icons
*   Localize labels and messages

### Layout[#](#layout)

*   Show or hide components based on context
*   Reorder buttons or entire sections
*   Rearrange dock elements or panel positions

### Behavior[#](#behavior)

*   Enable or disable specific features
*   Apply feature-based logic (e.g., show certain tools only for certain block types)

## Extending the UI[#](#extending-the-ui)

In addition to customizing what’s already there, you can **add entirely new functionality** to the UI:

*   **Quick Actions** — One-click tools that perform fast edits (e.g., remove background)
*   **Custom Buttons** — Add buttons to the dock, canvas menu, or canvas bar
*   **Custom Panels** — Create complex UIs to support advanced workflows like export wizards or AI tools
*   **Third-Party Integrations** — Connect with external APIs, such as QR generators or content management systems

Use the **Plugin API** to encapsulate these enhancements into portable, declarative extensions. These plugins can be dynamically loaded, reused across projects, and even distributed.

> Tip: You don’t need to use the Plugin API to modify the UI—but it’s the best approach when you want to encapsulate logic, reuse it, or offer it to others.

## Building Your Own UI[#](#building-your-own-ui)

While CE.SDK includes a fully-featured UI by default, you’re not locked into it. Many developers choose to **build a completely custom UI** on top of the CE.SDK engine. This approach gives you full control over layout, interaction patterns, and visual design.

When building your own UI, you interact directly with:

*   **The CE.SDK Engine** — Use the core APIs to manage scenes, create or modify blocks, control playback, and export content
*   **Canvas Rendering** — Render and manipulate the canvas area within your application shell
*   **State and Events** — Observe selections, listen for changes, and update your UI reactively

This approach is ideal when:

*   You need tight integration with a larger application or workflow
*   You want to match a highly specific design system
*   You’re building for a unique form factor or device
*   You need to simplify the UI dramatically for a focused use case

## Integrating with Custom Workflows[#](#integrating-with-custom-workflows)

The CE.SDK UI isn’t a closed system—it plays well with your broader application logic and workflows.

You can:

*   **Sync programmatic state** — Reflect external data (e.g., product names or image URLs) directly in the editor
*   **Control headless rendering** — Run the engine without the UI for automation or server-side rendering
*   **Trigger external logic** — Connect UI actions (like export) to your own backend services

The UI components can be programmatically configured, replaced, or completely bypassed depending on your needs. Whether you’re creating a collaborative editor, running batch jobs, or embedding CE.SDK in a no-code platform, you have full control over how the UI interacts with your app.

## Small Viewports[#](#small-viewports)

By default, CreativeEditor SDK is configured to use an optimized layout for small viewports.

The UI of the CreativeEditor SDK seamlessly adjusts to the available space, much like any other modern web application, without sacrificing functionality. Moreover, it provides a certain degree of customizability, allowing you to tailor the behavior of the UI to your specific needs.

This layout changes the UI to:

*   Render the dock on the bottom
*   Open all panels from the bottom, taking up the bottom half of the screen
*   Use the [large UI scaling](nextjs/user-interface/appearance/theming-4b0938/)

All configuration options related to the panel layout are ignored in favor of the layout optimization for small viewports as described above.

```

The CE.SDK editor includes an internationalization API that facilitates locale configuration management during runtime.

## I18N Configuration[#](#i18n-configuration)

*   **Setting the Locale**: The language of the user interface is now set using the `cesdk.i18n.setLocale()` API after creating the CreativeEditorSDK instance. The CE.SDK currently ships with locales for English `en` and German `de`. Additional languages will be available in the future. Until then, or if you want to provide custom wording and translations, you can provide your own translations using the `cesdk.i18n.setTranslations()` API, as described in the next paragraph.

```
  // Set the initial locale using the new API  instance.i18n.setLocale('fr');
```

*   **Translation Configuration**: Translations should now be set using the `cesdk.i18n.setTranslations()` API after creating the CreativeEditorSDK instance, instead of the deprecated `i18n` configuration option. Since the CE.SDK supports maintaining multiple locales at the same time, the first key in the map must always be the locale the translation is targeting. In this example, we change the back-button label for the locales `'fr'` and `'it'`.
    
    Please note that the fallback locale is `'en'`. So, with this configuration, the complete user interface would be English except for the back-button. Also, if you want to change a single label for one of our shipped translations, you do not have to add all keys, but only the one you want to override.
    
    A detailed overview of all available keys can be found in form of predefined language files inside `assets/i18n`. You can download the English version from our CDN here: [en.json](https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/assets/i18n/en.json)
    

```
// Set initial translations using the new APIinstance.i18n.setTranslations({  fr: {    'common.back': 'Retour',    'meta.currentLanguage': 'Français'  },  it: {    'common.back': 'Indietro',    'meta.currentLanguage': 'Italiano'  }});
```

*   Under the special key `meta.currentLanguage`, you should provide a short label for your provided language. This will be used to display the language in the language select dropdown of the editor customization panel.

```
'meta.currentLanguage': 'Français'
```

Here’s the full code:

```
const config = {  // license: import.meta.env.VITE_CESDK_LICENSE,  userId: 'guides-user',  ui: {    elements: {}  }};
```

## I18N API[#](#i18n-api)

Internationalisation can also be handled during runtime with a complementary set of APIs.

*   `cesdk.i18n.getLocale(): string` returns the currently set locale string, e.g. `"en"` for our default english locale.

```
const currentLocale = instance.i18n.getLocale();console.log({ currentLocale }); // Output: "fr"
```

*   `cesdk.i18n.setLocale(locale: string)` updates the locale to the string passed in as `locale` parameter. This is either one of our predefined strings (`"en"` for english or `"de"` for german) or any additionally configured locales.

```
instance.i18n.setLocale('it');const updatedLocale = instance.i18n.getLocale();console.log({ updatedLocale }); // Output: "it"
```

*   `cesdk.i18n.setTranslations(definition: { [locale: string]: object })` adds an object with translations to CE.SDK. This should be used instead of the deprecated `i18n` configuration option.

```
instance.i18n.setTranslations({  hr: {    'common.back': 'Poništi',    'meta.currentLanguage': 'Hrvatski'  },  sv: {    'common.back': 'Ångra',    'meta.currentLanguage': 'Svenska'  }});
```

*   `cesdk.i18n.listLocales(options?: { matcher?: string }): string[]` returns an array of all available locale strings that have translations loaded. Optionally accepts a wildcard pattern to filter locales.

```
const availableLocales = instance.i18n.listLocales({ matcher: '*' });console.log('Available locales:', availableLocales);
```

# Template Library

The IMG.LY Template Library provides a collection of customizable design templates that streamline the creation of graphics. These templates serve as a starting point for your users in generating designs.

Users select the Template from the Template Library, then apply it to their design, or merge it with data.

CE.SDK ships with a predefined set of default templates that can be added to your installation using the `addDemoAssetSources()` method.

You can also [create your own custom templates](nextjs/create-templates-3aef79/).

# Apply a Template

```
engine.scene.applyTemplateFromString('UBQ1ewoiZm9ybWF0Ij...');engine.scene.applyTemplateFromURL(  'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v1/ly.img.template/templates/cesdk_postcard_1.scene',);engine.scene.get();
```

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to apply the contents of a given template scene to the currently loaded scene through the `scene` API.

## Applying Template Scenes[#](#applying-template-scenes)

```
engine.scene.applyTemplateFromString(content: string): Promise<void>
```

Applies the contents of the given template scene to the currently loaded scene. This loads the template scene while keeping the design unit and page dimensions of the current scene. The content of the pages is automatically adjusted to fit the new dimensions.

*   `content`: The template scene file contents, a base64 string.
*   Returns A Promise that resolves once the template was applied or rejects if there was an error.

```
engine.scene.applyTemplateFromURL(url: string): Promise<void>
```

Applies the contents of the given template scene to the currently loaded scene. This loads the template scene while keeping the design unit and page dimensions of the current scene. The content of the pages is automatically adjusted to fit the new dimensions.

*   `url`: The url to the template scene file.
*   Returns A Promise that resolves once the template was applied or rejects if there was an error.

```
engine.scene.get(): DesignBlockId | null
```

Return the currently active scene.

*   Returns The scene or null, if none was created yet.

```

In this example, we want to show how to read and modify the text block’s contents via the API in the Headless CreativeEngine.

## Editing the Text String[#](#editing-the-text-string)

You can edit the text string contents of a text block using the `replaceText(id: DesignBlockId, text: string, from: number = -1, to: number = -1)` and `removeText(id: DesignBlockId, from: number = -1, to: number = -1)` APIs. The range of text that should be edited is defined using the UTF-16 indices \[from, to).

When omitting both the `from` and `to` arguments, the entire existing string is replaced.

```
engine.block.replaceText(text, 'Hello World');
```

When only specifying the `from` index, the new text is inserted at this index.

```
// Add a "!" at the end of the textengine.block.replaceText(text, '!', 11);
```

When both `from` and `to` indices are specified, then that range of text is replaced with the new text.

```
// Replace "World" with "Alex"engine.block.replaceText(text, 'Alex', 6, 11);
```

Similarly, the `removeText` API can be called to remove either a specific range or the entire text.

```
// Remove the "Hello "engine.block.removeText(text, 0, 6);
```

## Text Colors[#](#text-colors)

Text blocks in the CreativeEngine allow different ranges to have multiple colors.

Use the `setTextColor(id: DesignBlockId, color: RGBAColor | SpotColor, from: number = -1, to: number = -1)` API to change either the color of the entire text

```
engine.block.setTextColor(text, { r: 1.0, g: 1.0, b: 0.0, a: 1.0 });
```

or only that of a range. After these two calls, the text “Alex!” now starts with one yellow character, followed by three black characters and two more yellow ones.

```
engine.block.setTextColor(text, { r: 0.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 1.0 }, 1, 4);
```

The `getTextColors(id: DesignBlockId, from: number = -1, to: number = -1): Array<RGBAColor | SpotColor>` API returns an ordered list of unique colors in the requested range. Here, `allColors` will be an array containing the colors yellow and black (in this order).

```
const allColors = engine.block.getTextColors(text);
```

When only the colors in the UTF-16 range from 2 to 5 are requested, the result will be an array containing black and then yellow, since black appears first in the requested range.

```
const colorsInRange = engine.block.getTextColors(text, 2, 5);
```

## Text Background[#](#text-background)

You can create and edit the background of a text block by setting specific block properties.

To add a colored background to a text block use the `setBool(id: DesignBlockId, property: string, value: boolean)` API and enable the `backgroundColor/enabled` property.

```
engine.block.setBool(text, 'backgroundColor/enabled', true);
```

The color of the text background can be queried (by making use of the `getColor(id: DesignBlockID, property: string)` API ) and also changed (with the `setColor(id: DesignBlockID, property: string, color: color)` API).

```
const color = engine.block.getColor(text, 'backgroundColor/color');
```

The padding of the rectangular background shape can be edited by using the `setFloat(id: DesignBlockId, property: string, value: number)` API and setting the target value for the desired padding property like:

*   `backgroundColor/paddingLeft`:
*   `backgroundColor/paddingRight`:
*   `backgroundColor/paddingTop`:
*   `backgroundColor/paddingBottom`:

```
engine.block.setFloat(text, 'backgroundColor/paddingLeft', 1);
```

Additionally, the rectangular shape of the background can be rounded by setting a corner radius with the `setFloat(id: DesignBlockId, property: string, value: number)` API to adjust the value of the `backgroundColor/cornerRadius` property.

```
engine.block.setFloat(text, 'backgroundColor/cornerRadius', 5);
```

Text backgrounds inherit the animations assigned to their respective text block when the animation text writing style is set to `Block`.

```
const animation = engine.block.createAnimation('slide');
```

## Text Case[#](#text-case)

You can apply text case modifications to ranges of text in order to display them in upper case, lower case or title case. It is important to note that these modifiers do not change the `text` string value of the text block but are only applied when the block is rendered.

By default, the text case of all text within a text block is set to `Normal`, which does not modify the appearance of the text at all.

The `setTextCase(id: DesignBlockId, textCase: TextCase, from: number = -1, to: number = -1): void` API sets the given text case for the selected range of text.

Possible values for `TextCase` are:

*   `Normal`: The text string is rendered without modifications.
*   `Uppercase`: All characters are rendered in upper case.
*   `Lowercase`: All characters are rendered in lower case.
*   `Titlecase`: The first character of each word is rendered in upper case.

```
engine.block.setTextCase(text, 'Titlecase');
```

The `getTextCases(id: DesignBlockId, from: number = -1, to: number = -1): TextCase[]` API returns the ordered list of text cases of the text in the selected range.

```
const textCases = engine.block.getTextCases(text);
```

## Typefaces[#](#typefaces)

In order to change the font of a text block, you have to call the `setFont(id: DesignBlockId, fontFileUri: string, typeface: Typeface)` API and provide it with both the uri of the font file to be actively used and the complete typeface definition of the corresponding typeface. Existing formatting of the block is reset.

A typeface definition consists of the unique typeface name (as it is defined within the font files), and a list of all font definitions that belong to this typeface. Each font definition must provide a `uri` string which points to the font file and a `subFamily` string which is this font’s effective name within its typeface. The subfamily value is typically also defined within the font file. The `weight` and `style` properties default to `normal`, but must be provided in other cases.

For the sake of this example, we define a `Roboto` typeface with only four fonts: `Regular`, `Bold`, `Italic`, and `Bold Italic` and we change the font of the text block to the Roboto Regular font.

```
const typeface = {  name: 'Roboto',  fonts: [    {      uri: 'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/v2/ly.img.typeface/fonts/Roboto/Roboto-Bold.ttf',      subFamily: 'Bold',      weight: 'bold'    },    {      uri: 'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/v2/ly.img.typeface/fonts/Roboto/Roboto-BoldItalic.ttf',      subFamily: 'Bold Italic',      weight: 'bold',      style: 'italic'    },    {      uri: 'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/v2/ly.img.typeface/fonts/Roboto/Roboto-Italic.ttf',      subFamily: 'Italic',      style: 'italic'    },    {      uri: 'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/v2/ly.img.typeface/fonts/Roboto/Roboto-Regular.ttf',      subFamily: 'Regular'    }  ]};engine.block.setFont(text, typeface.fonts[3].uri, typeface);
```

If the formatting, e.g., bold or italic, of the text should be kept, you have to call the `fun setTypeface(block: DesignBlock, fontFileUri: Uri, typeface: Typeface)` API and provide it with both the uri of the font file to be used and the complete typeface definition of the corresponding typeface. The font file should be a fallback font, e.g., `Regular`, from the same typeface. The actual font that matches the formatting is chosen automatically with the current formatting retained as much as possible. If the new typeface does not support the current formatting, the formatting changes to a reasonable close one, e.g. thin might change to light, bold to normal, and/or italic to non-italic. If no reasonable font can be found, the fallback font is used.

```
engine.block.setTypeface(text, typeface);
```

You can query the currently used typeface definition of a text block by calling the `getTypeface(id: DesignBlockId): Typeface` API. It is important to note that new text blocks don’t have any explicit typeface set until you call the `setFont` API. In this case, the `getTypeface` API will throw an error.

```
const currentDefaultTypeface = engine.block.getTypeface(text);
```

## Font Weights and Styles[#](#font-weights-and-styles)

Text blocks can also have multiple ranges with different weights and styles.

In order to toggle the text of a text block between the normal and bold font weights, first call the `canToggleBoldFont(id: DesignBlockId, from: number = -1, to: number = -1): boolean` API to check whether such an edit is possible and if so, call the `toggleBoldFont(id: DesignBlockId, from: number = -1, to: number = -1)` API to change the weight.

```
if (engine.block.canToggleBoldFont(text)) {  engine.block.toggleBoldFont(text);}if (engine.block.canToggleBoldFont(text, 1, 4)) {  engine.block.toggleBoldFont(text, 1, 4);}
```

In order to toggle the text of a text block between the normal and italic font styles, first call the `canToggleItalicFont(id: DesignBlockId, from: number = -1, to: number = -1): boolean` API to check whether such an edit is possible and if so, call the `toggleItalicFont(id: DesignBlockId, from: number = -1, to: number = -1)` API to change the style.

```
if (engine.block.canToggleItalicFont(text)) {  engine.block.toggleItalicFont(text);}if (engine.block.canToggleItalicFont(text, 1, 4)) {  engine.block.toggleItalicFont(text, 1, 4);}
```

In order to change the font weight or style, the typeface definition of the text block must include a font definition that corresponds to the requested font weight and style combination. For example, if the text block currently uses a bold font and you want to toggle the font style to italic - such as in the example code - the typeface must contain a font that is both bold and italic.

The `getTextFontWeights(id: DesignBlockId, from: number = -1, to: number = -1): FontWeight[]` API returns an ordered list of unique font weights in the requested range, similar to the `getTextColors` API described above. For this example text, the result will be \[‘bold’\].

```
const fontWeights = engine.block.getTextFontWeights(text);
```

The `getTextFontStyles(id: DesignBlockId, from: number = -1, to: number = -1): FontStyle[]` API returns an ordered list of unique font styles in the requested range, similar to the `getTextColors` API described above. For this example text, the result will be \[‘italic’\].

```
const fontStyles = engine.block.getTextFontStyles(text);
```

# Font Combinations

Font Combinations (also known as Text Components) are pre-designed text layouts that appear in your asset library. Users can click on these components to automatically insert them into their designs. This guide explains how to prepare and customize the `content.json` file that defines these components.

## What are Font Combinations?[#](#what-are-font-combinations)

Font Combinations are serialized text blocks or groups of text blocks configured with specific styling, layout constraints, and behavior. They provide users with professionally designed text layouts that are easy to customize while maintaining their visual integrity.

When users browse the asset library, they see thumbnails of these text components. Clicking on a component automatically loads and inserts it into their current scene.

## Default Components[#](#default-components)

CE.SDK ships with over 20 pre-built font combinations including:

*   **Box** - Text with decorative border elements
*   **Breaking** - Bold, attention-grabbing headlines
*   **Cinematic** - Movie poster-style text effects
*   **Glow** - Text with luminous glow effects
*   **Greetings** - Welcoming message layouts
*   **Promo** - Promotional and sale-focused designs
*   **Quote** - Quote bubble and callout styles
*   **Speech** - Dialog and conversation layouts
*   **Valentine** - Romantic and heart-themed designs
*   **Handwriting** - Script and handwritten font styles
*   And many more…

## Content.json Structure[#](#contentjson-structure)

Font combinations are defined in a `content.json` file with the following structure:

```
{  "version": "3.0.0",  "id": "ly.img.textComponents",  "assets": [    {      "id": "//ly.img.textComponents/box",      "label": {        "en": "Box"      },      "meta": {        "uri": "{{base_url}}/ly.img.textComponents/data/Box.blocks",        "thumbUri": "{{base_url}}/ly.img.textComponents/thumbnails/box.png",        "mimeType": "application/ubq-blocks-string"      }    }  ],  "blocks": []}
```

### Key Properties[#](#key-properties)

*   **version**: Content format version (currently “3.0.0”)
*   **id**: Unique identifier for the asset source (“ly.img.textComponents”)
*   **assets**: Array of component definitions

### Asset Properties[#](#asset-properties)

Each component in the assets array has:

*   **id**: Unique identifier following the pattern `//ly.img.textComponents/[name]`
*   **label**: Display name object with language codes (e.g., `{"en": "Box"}`)
*   **meta**:
    *   **uri**: Path to the `.blocks` file containing the serialized component
    *   **thumbUri**: Path to the thumbnail image (400x320px PNG recommended)
    *   **mimeType**: Always `"application/ubq-blocks-string"` for text components

The `{{base_url}}` placeholder gets replaced with your configured base URL.

*   Use **variable text** with a range of 0-1000 characters
*   Set **fixed frame** with **clipping enabled**
*   Avoid growing or shrinking frames to prevent scaling issues

#### Constraints Setup[#](#constraints-setup)

*   **Parent Group**: Give the parent group all available constraint options for maximum flexibility
*   **Child Elements**: Set constraints relative to the parent group to maintain proper relationships during resizing

#### Design Considerations[#](#design-considerations)

*   Use **scopes** and **auto font-size** features to enable easy editing
*   Test components by dropping them into new files to verify constraint behavior
*   Ensure components work as cohesive units that are easy to edit but difficult to accidentally break

### 2\. Export Your Component[#](#2-export-your-component)

Once your design is ready:

1.  Select the complete text component (parent group with all children)
2.  Use the BlockAPI to serialize it:

```
// Save the component to a string formatconst componentString = await engine.block.saveToString([componentBlockId]);
```

**Important**: Use `saveToString()` rather than `saveToArchive()`. The string format ensures that font and resource references remain valid when the component is used in different environments.

#### Resource Management[#](#resource-management)

Text components often reference external resources like fonts and images. When using `saveToArchive()`, these resources get stored as temporary `buffer` resources that only exist in the current editor instance. If you later save the scene containing these components using `scene.saveToString()`, the buffer resources are lost, resulting in missing references.

Using `saveToString()` ensures that:

*   Font references remain valid across different environments
*   Components can be safely used in any scene
*   Serialized scenes maintain all resource references

**Best Practices:**

1.  **Ensure font availability**: Make sure all fonts used in your components are available in the target environment
2.  **Test in isolation**: Always test components in fresh editor instances to verify resource loading
3.  **Validate references**: Check that all asset URIs are accessible from your target environments

### 3\. Create Component Files[#](#3-create-component-files)

#### Save the .blocks File[#](#save-the-blocks-file)

Save the serialized component string to a `.blocks` file:

*   Use descriptive names matching your component ID (e.g., `CustomBox.blocks`)
*   Store in your `/data/` directory structure

#### Create Thumbnails[#](#create-thumbnails)

Generate 400x320px PNG thumbnails:

1.  Remove page background color from your design
2.  Export as PNG using the block export API:

```
// Export component as 400x320px thumbnailconst thumbnailBlob = await engine.block.export(componentBlockId, {  mimeType: 'image/png',  targetWidth: 400,  targetHeight: 320,});
// Save thumbnail to fileconst thumbnailBuffer = await thumbnailBlob.arrayBuffer();// Save thumbnailBuffer to your thumbnail file (e.g., customBox.png)
```

### 4\. Update content.json[#](#4-update-contentjson)

Add your new component to the assets array:

```
{  "id": "//ly.img.textComponents/customBox",  "label": {    "en": "Custom Box",    "de": "Eigene Box"  },  "meta": {    "uri": "{{base_url}}/ly.img.textComponents/data/CustomBox.blocks",    "thumbUri": "{{base_url}}/ly.img.textComponents/thumbnails/customBox.png",    "mimeType": "application/ubq-blocks-string"  }}
```

## Hosting Custom Components[#](#hosting-custom-components)

### Backend Setup[#](#backend-setup)

1.  **Host your files**: Upload your modified `content.json`, `.blocks` files, and thumbnails to your web server
2.  **Maintain structure**: Keep the same directory structure:
    
    ```
    /ly.img.textComponents/├── content.json├── data/│   ├── Box.blocks│   ├── CustomBox.blocks│   └── ...└── thumbnails/    ├── box.png    ├── customBox.png    └── ...
    ```
    

### Configuration[#](#configuration)

To customize your application to use your custom assets, refer to [Serve Assets](nextjs/serve-assets-b0827c/).

Your custom font combinations will now appear in the text components section of the asset library.

Text blocks in CE.SDK support the use of emojis. A default emoji font is used to render these independently from the target platform. This guide shows how to change the default font and use emojis in text blocks.

## Change the Default Emoji Font[#](#change-the-default-emoji-font)

The default font URI can be changed when another emoji font should be used or when the font should be served from another website, a content delivery network (CDN), or a file path.

The preset is to use the [NotoColorEmoji](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji) font loaded from our [CDN](https://cdn.img.ly/assets/v4/emoji/NotoColorEmoji.ttf). This font file supports a wide variety of Emojis and is licensed under the [Open Font License](https://cdn.img.ly/assets/v4/emoji/LICENSE.txt). The file is relatively small with 9.9 MB but has the emojis stored as PNG images.

As an alternative for higher quality emojis, e.g., this [NotoColorEmoji](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Color+Emoji) font can be used. This font file supports also a wide variety of Emojis and is licensed under the [SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Color+Emoji/license). The file is significantly larger with 24.3 MB but has the emojis stored as vector graphics.

In order to change the emoji font URI, call the `setSetting(keypath: string, value: any)` [Editor API](nextjs/settings-970c98/) with ‘defaultEmojiFontFileUri’ as keypath and the new URI as value.

```
const uri = engine.editor.getSetting('defaultEmojiFontFileUri');// From a bundleengine.editor.setSetting(  'defaultEmojiFontFileUri',  'bundle://ly.img.cesdk/fonts/NotoColorEmoji.ttf');// From a URLengine.editor.setSetting(  'defaultEmojiFontFileUri',  'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/v2/emoji/NotoColorEmoji.ttf');
```

## Add a Text Block with an Emoji[#](#add-a-text-block-with-an-emoji)

To add a text block with an emoji, add a text block and set the emoji as text content.

```
const text = engine.block.create('text');engine.block.setString(text, 'text/text', 'Text with an emoji 🧐');engine.block.setWidthMode(text, 'Auto');engine.block.setHeightMode(text, 'Auto');engine.block.appendChild(page, text);
```

```

In this example, we want to show how to set up text editing in the Headless CreativeEngine.

Depending on your use cases, text editing can require a little more complicated setup, because the focus for the user’s keyboard input might need to be managed between the CreativeEngine itself and your UI components.

## Text Edit Mode[#](#text-edit-mode)

The Engine always operates in one of three `EditMode`s:

*   `Transform`: In this mode you can transform blocks in the scene by moving them around, selecting, or resizing them. This is the default mode.
*   `Crop`: This mode is used when cropping image blocks.
*   `Text`: Then double-clicking on a text block, the engine switches to this mode to let you edit the text content of a text block.

You can query and set the `EditMode` using the EditorAPI’s `getEditMode()` and `setEditMode(mode)` methods. Certain interactions will cause the engine to switch the mode by itself (such as double-clicking on a text block).

You get notified of changes in the EditorState using the `onStateChanged` method of the EditorAPI. Inside the callback, use `getEditMode()` to know the current mode.

## Text Editing Focus[#](#text-editing-focus)

When the engine enters `Text` mode, it will focus the browser’s input on the text content of the block you are editing. From here, several things can happen:

*   The user presses `ESC`, clicks somewhere on the canvas outside of the text block, or `Text` mode is ended via a call to `setEditMode('Transform')`. In this case, the browser will blur the text input of the engine, and you are back in the `Transform` mode.
*   The user focuses a text input field, number input field, text area or a contentEditable element outside of the canvas. In this case the engine will stay in `Text` mode, but will no longer have focus. Keyboard input will now go to the input field that has received focus.
*   The user clicks on a blank space or any focusable DOM element, that does not require keyboard input.

This behavior should be sufficient for most use cases. If your requirements are more complicated, we provide a way to customize what’s happening through events.

## CreativeEngine DOM Events[#](#creativeengine-dom-events)

There are currently two types of custom DOM events that the CreativeEngine dispatches on the `canvas` element. You can add a listener for it there or on any of its parent elements.

### `cesdk-blur`[#](#cesdk-blur)

When the text input in the engine has been blurred, this event will be dispatched. You can call `preventDefault()` on the event to force focus back to the canvas input. The `event.detail` property will contain a reference to the element that has received focus (if available, otherwise it’s `null`). You can use that element during the decision whether to call `preventDefault()`.

A use case for this could be to prevent disabling the text-input heuristic, forcing refocus even if the user clicked on a text input, or to call `editor.setEditMode('Transform')` to exit the text edit mode whenever the input is blurred.

### `cesdk-refocus`[#](#cesdk-refocus)

Just before the engine refocuses its text input, you can call `preventDefault()` on this event to prevent this from happening. This event also contains currently focused element (or `null`) it in its `event.detail` property.

A use case for this would be to treat a particular input element as if it were a text input and let it keep keyboard focus after it’s been focused.

    cesdk.editor.setEditMode('Transform');    cesdk.editor.onStateChanged(() => {      console.log('EditMode is ', cesdk.editor.getEditMode());    });
    document.addEventListener('cesdk-blur', event => {      const relatedTarget = event.detail;
      if (focusShouldStayOnEngine(relatedTarget)) {        event.preventDefault();      } else if (engineShouldExitTextMode(relatedTarget)) {        cesdk.editor.setEditMode('Transform');      }    });

```

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to edit ranges within text blocks.

```

The CreativeEditor SDK allows adding text elements to the scene. The available fonts can be controlled by creating custom asset sources and then updating the typeface library entry using the API.

Added typefaces are directly accessible from the typeface dropdown in the text inspector:

  

![](/docs/cesdk/_astro/typefaces-light.BMb5_7Kl_28hgxj.webp)

  

## Configuring Custom Typefaces[#](#configuring-custom-typefaces)

You can define your own typefaces by [creating a custom asset source](nextjs/import-media/from-remote-source/unsplash-8f31f0/) and then updating the typeface library entry using `cesdk.ui.updateAssetLibraryEntry('ly.img.typefaces', { sourceIds: [...] })`. Each of the asset objects in the asset source must define a value for its `payload.typeface` property. A typeface consists of the following properties:

```
// Add a custom typeface asset source.instance.engine.asset.addLocalSource('my-custom-typefaces');instance.engine.asset.addAssetToSource('my-custom-typefaces', {  id: 'orbitron',  label: {    en: 'Orbitron'  },  payload: {    typeface: {      name: 'Orbitron',      fonts: [        {          uri: `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}/Orbitron-Regular.ttf`,          subFamily: 'Regular',          weight: 'regular',          style: 'normal'        },        {          uri: `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}/Orbitron-Bold.ttf`,          subFamily: 'Bold',          weight: 'bold',          style: 'normal'        }      ]    }  }});
```

*   `name: string` the name of the typeface, which is also shown in the dropdown.

```
name: 'Orbitron',
```

*   `fonts[]: Object` an array of objects, where each object describes a single font of the typeface. Each font has the following properties:
    *   `uri: string` points at the font file for this font style. Supports `http(s)://` and relative paths which resolve to the `baseURL`. TrueType, OpenType, and WOFF (and WOFF2) formats are supported.
    *   `subFamily: string` of the font. This is an arbitrary string as defined by the font file, e.g. ‘Regular’, ‘ExtraBold Italic’, ‘Book’, ‘Oblique’, etc. It is shown in the style dropdown in the inspector which lets users choose between all fonts of the selected typeface.
    *   `weight: string` of the font. One of `thin`, `extraLight`, `light`, `normal`, `medium`, `semiBold`, `bold`, `extraBold`, `heavy`. Defaults to `normal`.
    *   `style: string` of the font. One of `normal` & `italic`. Defaults to `normal`.

```
fonts: [  {    uri: `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}/Orbitron-Regular.ttf`,    subFamily: 'Regular',    weight: 'regular',    style: 'normal'  },  {    uri: `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}/Orbitron-Bold.ttf`,    subFamily: 'Bold',    weight: 'bold',    style: 'normal'  }]
```

## Removing the Default Typefaces[#](#removing-the-default-typefaces)

In case you want to remove all of the default typefaces we ship with the CE.SDK editor, you need to update the typeface library entry to exclude the default asset source `ly.img.typeface`.

```
cesdk.ui.updateAssetLibraryEntry('ly.img.typefaces', {  sourceIds: ['myCustomTypefaces'] // Only include your custom source, excluding 'ly.img.typeface'});
```

```

Cutouts are a special feature one can use with cuttings printers. When printing a PDF file containing cutouts paths, a cutting printer will cut these paths with a cutter rather than print them with ink. Use cutouts to create stickers, iron on decals, etc.

Cutouts can be created from an SVG string describing its underlying shape. Cutouts can also be created from combining multiple existing cutouts using the boolean operations `Union`, `Difference`, `Intersection` and `XOR`.

Cutouts have a type property which can take one of two values: `Solid` and `Dashed`. Cutting printers recognize cutouts paths through their specially named spot colors. By default, `Solid` cutouts have the spot color `"CutContour"` to produce a continuous cutting line and `Dashed` cutouts have the spot colors `"PerfCutContour"` to produce a perforated cutting line. You may need to adjust these spot color names for you printer.

**Note** Note that the actual color approximation given to the spot color does not affect how the cutting printer interprets the cutout, only how it is rendered. The default color approximations are magenta for “CutContour” and green for “PerfCutContour”.

​Cutouts have an offset property that determines the distance at which the cutout path is rendered from the underlying path set when created.

## Setup the scene[#](#setup-the-scene)

We first create a new scene with a new page.

```
  document.getElementById('cesdk_container').append(engine.element);
  const scene = engine.scene.create();
  const page = engine.block.create('page');  engine.block.setWidth(page, 800);  engine.block.setHeight(page, 600);  engine.block.appendChild(scene, page);  engine.scene.zoomToBlock(page, 50, 50, 50, 50);
```

## Create cutouts[#](#create-cutouts)

Here we add two cutouts. First, a circle of type `Dashed` and with an offset of 3.0. Second, a square of default type `Solid` and an offset of 6.0.

```
  const circle = engine.block.createCutoutFromPath(    'M 0,25 a 25,25 0 1,1 50,0 a 25,25 0 1,1 -50,0 Z'  );  engine.block.appendChild(page, circle);  engine.block.setFloat(circle, 'cutout/offset', 3.0);  engine.block.setEnum(circle, 'cutout/type', 'Dashed');
  const square = engine.block.createCutoutFromPath('M 0,0 H 50 V 50 H 0 Z');  engine.block.appendChild(page, square);  engine.block.setPositionX(square, 50);  engine.block.setFloat(square, 'cutout/offset', 6.0);
```

## Combining multiple cutouts into one[#](#combining-multiple-cutouts-into-one)

Here we use the `Union` operation to create a new cutout that consists of the combination of the earlier two cutouts we have created. Note that we destroy the previously created `circle` and `square` cutouts as we don’t need them anymore and we certainly don’t want to printer to cut through those paths as well.

When combining multiple cutouts, the resulting cutout will be of the type of the first cutout given and an offset of 0. In this example, since the `circle` cutout is of type `Dashed`, the newly created cutout will also be of type `Dashed`.

**Warning** When using the Difference operation, the first cutout is the cutout that is subtracted _from_. For other operations, the order of the cutouts don’t matter.

```
const union = engine.block.createCutoutFromOperation(  [circle, square],  'Union');engine.block.appendChild(page, union);engine.block.destroy(circle);engine.block.destroy(square);
```

## Change the default color for Solid cutouts[#](#change-the-default-color-for-solid-cutouts)

For some reason, we’d like the cutouts of type `Solid` to not render as magenta but as blue. Knowing that `"CutContour"` is the spot color associated with `Solid`, we change it RGB approximation to blue. Thought the cutout will render as blue, the printer will still interpret this path as a cutting because of its special spot color name.

```
engine.editor.setSpotColorRGB('CutContour', 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
```

## Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here’s the full code:

```

<!doctype html><html lang="en">  <head>    <meta charset="UTF-8" />    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />    <style>      body {        margin: 0;        overflow: hidden;      }      html {        overscroll-behavior-x: contain;      }    </style>  </head>
  <body>    <div id="cesdk_container" style="width: 100%; height: 100vh"></div>    <script type="module" src="index.js"></script>  </body></html>
```

You can use four different boolean operations on blocks to combine them into unique shapes. These operations are:

*   `'Union'`: adds all the blocks’ shapes into one
*   `'Difference'`: removes from the bottom-most block the shapes of the other blocks overlapping with it
*   `'Intersection'`: keeps only the overlapping parts of all the blocks’ shapes
*   `'XOR'`: removes the overlapping parts of all the block’s shapes

Combining blocks allows you to create a new block with a customized shape.

Combining blocks with the `union`, `intersection` or `XOR` operation will result in the new block whose fill is that of the top-most block and whose shape is the result of applying the operation pair-wise on blocks from the top-most block to the bottom-most block.

Combining blocks with the `difference` operation will result in the new block whose fill is that of the bottom-most block and whose shape is the result of applying the operation pair-wise on blocks from the bottom-most block to the top-most block.

The combined blocks will be destroyed.

**Only the following blocks can be combined**

*   A graphics block
*   A text block

```
isCombinable(ids: DesignBlockId[]): boolean
```

Checks whether blocks could be combined. Only graphics blocks and text blocks can be combined. All blocks must have the “lifecycle/duplicate” scope enabled.

*   `ids`: An array of block ids.
*   Returns Whether the blocks can be combined.

```
combine(ids: DesignBlockId[], op: BooleanOperation): DesignBlockId
```

Perform a boolean operation on the given blocks. All blocks must be combinable. See `isCombinable`. The parent, fill and sort order of the new block is that of the prioritized block. When performing a `Union`, `Intersection` or `XOR`, the operation is performed pair-wise starting with the element with the highest sort order. When performing a `Difference`, the operation is performed pair-wise starting with the element with the lowest sort order. Required scopes: ‘lifecycle/duplicate’, ‘lifecycle/destroy’

*   `ids`: The blocks to combine. They will be destroyed if “lifecycle/destroy” scope is enabled.
*   `op`: The boolean operation to perform.
*   Returns The newly created block or an error.

Here’s the full code:

```
// Create blocks and append to sceneconst star = engine.block.create('shapes/star');const rect = engine.block.create('shapes/rect');engine.block.appendChild(page, star);engine.block.appendChild(page, rect);
// Check whether the blocks may be combinedconst combinable = engine.block.isCombinable([star, rect]);if (combinable) {  const combined = engine.block.combine([star, rect], 'Union');}
```

## Combining three circles together[#](#combining-three-circles-together)

We create three circles and arrange in a recognizable pattern. Combing them with `'Union'` result in a single block with a unique shape. The result will inherit the top-most block’s fill, in this case `circle3`’s fill.

```
  const circle1 = engine.block.create('graphic');  engine.block.setShape(circle1, engine.block.createShape('ellipse'));  engine.block.setFill(circle1, engine.block.createFill('color'));  engine.block.setPositionX(circle1, 30);  engine.block.setPositionY(circle1, 30);  engine.block.setWidth(circle1, 40);  engine.block.setHeight(circle1, 40);  engine.block.appendChild(page, circle1);
  const circle2 = engine.block.create('graphic');  engine.block.setShape(circle2, engine.block.createShape('ellipse'));  engine.block.setFill(circle2, engine.block.createFill('color'));  engine.block.setPositionX(circle2, 80);  engine.block.setPositionY(circle2, 30);  engine.block.setWidth(circle2, 40);  engine.block.setHeight(circle2, 40);  engine.block.appendChild(page, circle2);
  const circle3 = engine.block.create('graphic');  engine.block.setShape(circle3, engine.block.createShape('ellipse'));  engine.block.setFill(circle3, engine.block.createFill('color'));  engine.block.setPositionX(circle3, 50);  engine.block.setPositionY(circle3, 50);  engine.block.setWidth(circle3, 50);  engine.block.setHeight(circle3, 50);  engine.block.appendChild(page, circle3);
  const union = engine.block.combine([circle1, circle2, circle3], 'Union');
```

To create a special effect of text punched out from an image, we create an image and a text. We ensure that the image is at the bottom as that is the base block from which we want to remove shapes. The result will be a block with the size, shape and fill of the image but with a hole in it in the shape of the removed text.

```
  const text = engine.block.create('text');  engine.block.replaceText(text, 'Removed text');  engine.block.setPositionX(text, 10);  engine.block.setPositionY(text, 40);  engine.block.setWidth(text, 80);  engine.block.setHeight(text, 10);  engine.block.appendChild(page, text);
  const image = engine.block.create('graphic');  engine.block.setShape(image, engine.block.createShape('rect'));  const imageFill = engine.block.createFill('image');  engine.block.setFill(image, imageFill);  engine.block.setPositionX(image, 0);  engine.block.setPositionY(image, 0);  engine.block.setWidth(image, 100);  engine.block.setHeight(image, 100);  engine.block.setString(    imageFill,    'fill/image/imageFileURI',    'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1.jpg'  );  engine.block.appendChild(page, image);
  engine.block.sendToBack(image);  const difference = engine.block.combine([image, text], 'Difference');
```

The CE.SDK photo editor UI is a specific configuration of the CE.SDK that focuses the Editor UI on essential photo editing features.

It also includes our powerful background removal plugin that runs entirely on the user’s device, saving on computing costs.

This configuration can be further modified to suit your needs.

Key components include: ![](/docs/cesdk/_astro/CESDK-UI.BD2Iwmum_2gw9UM.webp)

*   **Canvas:** The primary workspace where users interact with their photo content.
*   **Dock:** Provides access to tools and assets that are not directly related to the selected image or block, often used for adding or managing assets.
*   **Inspector Bar:** Controls properties specific to the selected block, such as size, rotation, and other adjustments.
*   **Canvas Menu:** Provides block-specific settings and actions such as deletion or duplication.
*   **Navigation Bar:** Offers global actions such as undo/redo, zoom controls, and access to export options.
*   **Canvas Bar:** For actions affecting the canvas or scene as a whole, such as adding pages or controlling zoom. This is an alternative place for actions like zoom or undo/redo.

Learn more about interacting with and customizing the photo editor UI in our design editor UI guide.

### CreativeEngine[#](#creativeengine)

At the heart of CE.SDK is the CreativeEngine, which powers all rendering and design manipulation tasks.

It can be used in headless mode or integrated with the CreativeEditor UI.

Key features and APIs provided by CreativeEngine include:

*   **Scene Management:** Create, load, save, and manipulate design scenes programmatically.
*   **Block Manipulation:** Create and manage elements such as images, text, and shapes within the scene.
*   **Asset Management:** Load and manage assets like images and SVGs from URLs or local sources.
*   **Variable Management:** Define and manipulate variables for dynamic content within scenes.
*   **Event Handling:** Subscribe to events such as block creation or selection changes for dynamic interaction.

## API Overview[#](#api-overview)

CE.SDK’s APIs are organized into several categories, each addressing different aspects of scene and content management.

The engine API is relevant if you want to programmatically manipulate images to create or modify them at scale.

[**Scene API:**](nextjs/concepts/scenes-e8596d/)\- **Creating and Loading Scenes**:

```
engine.scene.create();engine.scene.loadFromURL(url);
```

*   **Zoom Control**:

```
engine.scene.setZoomLevel(1.0);engine.scene.zoomToBlock(blockId);
```

[**Block API:**](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/)\- **Creating Blocks**:

```
const block = engine.block.create('shapes/rectangle');
```

*   **Setting Properties**:

```
engine.block.setColor(blockId, 'fill/color', { r: 1, g: 0, b: 0, a: 1 });engine.block.setString(blockId, 'text/content', 'Hello World');
```

*   **Querying Properties**:

```
const color = engine.block.getColor(blockId, 'fill/color');const text = engine.block.getString(blockId, 'text/content');
```

[**Variable API:**](nextjs/create-templates/add-dynamic-content/text-variables-7ecb50/)\- **Managing Variables**:

```
engine.variable.setString('myVariable', 'value');const value = engine.variable.getString('myVariable');
```

[**Asset API:**](nextjs/import-media/concepts-5e6197/)\- **Managing Assets**:

```
engine.asset.add('image', 'https://example.com/image.png');
```

[**Event API:**](nextjs/concepts/events-353f97/)\- **Subscribing to Events**:

```
// Subscribe to scene changesengine.scene.onActiveChanged(() => {  const newActiveScene = engine.scene.get();});
```

## Basic Automation Example[#](#basic-automation-example)

The following automation example shows how to turn an image block into a square format for a platform such as Instagram:

```

GitHub](https://github.com/imgly/cesdk-web-examples/tree/main/plugins-print-ready-pdf-browser)

  

## What You’ll Build[#](#what-youll-build)

A complete print-ready PDF export workflow that:

*   Adds a custom “Export Print-Ready PDF” button to CE.SDK
*   Exports designs as standard PDFs using CE.SDK’s engine
*   Converts RGB PDFs to CMYK with professional ICC profiles
*   Adds PDF/X-3:2003 compliance for commercial printing
*   Handles transparency flattening automatically
*   Downloads print-ready files directly in the browser

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites)

*   Modern browser with WebAssembly support (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
*   Basic knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript and CE.SDK
*   Optional: CE.SDK license to remove watermark - [Get a free trial](https://img.ly/forms/free-trial)

## Step 1: Install the Plugin[#](#step-1-install-the-plugin)

First, add the Print Ready PDF plugin to your project alongside CE.SDK:

Terminal window

```
npm install @cesdk/cesdk-js @imgly/plugin-print-ready-pdfs-web@1.0.0
```

The plugin is a standalone npm package that works with any CE.SDK integration.

**Package details:**

*   `@cesdk/cesdk-js`: CE.SDK core library
*   `@imgly/plugin-print-ready-pdfs-web`: Print-ready PDF conversion plugin

**Try it yourself:**

1.  Run `npm install` in your project
2.  Verify packages appear in `package.json`
3.  Check node\_modules contains both packages

## Step 2: Set Up CE.SDK with Custom Export Button[#](#step-2-set-up-cesdk-with-custom-export-button)

Initialize CE.SDK and add a custom export button to the navigation bar:

```
// Initialize CE.SDKconst cesdk = await CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk-container', config);
// Add custom export button to navigation barcesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: [    {      key: 'export-print-ready-pdf',      id: 'ly.img.action.navigationBar',      label: 'Export Print-Ready PDF',      iconName: '@imgly/Download',      onClick: async () => {        await exportPrintReadyPDF();      },    },  ],});
```

**CE.SDK concepts explained:**

*   **`insertNavigationBarOrderComponent()`**: Dynamically adds UI components to the navigation bar
*   **`'last'`**: Position for the button (can be ‘first’, ‘last’, or after specific components)
*   **`iconName`**: Uses CE.SDK’s built-in icon library (`@imgly/icons/`)
*   **`onClick`**: Function executed when button is clicked

The custom action button integrates seamlessly with CE.SDK’s UI, appearing alongside built-in export options.

**Verify the integration:**

1.  Start your development server
2.  Open CE.SDK in the browser
3.  Look for “Export Print-Ready PDF” button in the navigation bar
4.  Button should be clickable (even if export isn’t implemented yet)

## Step 3: Export PDF from CE.SDK[#](#step-3-export-pdf-from-cesdk)

Now implement the export logic to get the PDF from CE.SDK’s engine:

```
// Get current scene IDconst scene = cesdk.engine.scene.get();
// Get all pages in the sceneconst pages = cesdk.engine.block.findByType('page');
// Export first page as PDFconst pdfBlob = await cesdk.engine.block.export(pages[0], {  mimeType: 'application/pdf',});
```

**CE.SDK export methods in detail:**

*   **`engine.scene.get()`**: Returns the ID of the current scene (the design being edited)
*   **`engine.block.export()`**: Exports a specific block (in this case, the entire scene) as a Blob
*   **`'application/pdf'`**: MIME type specifying PDF format output

The `engine.block.export()` method is the recommended approach for PDF export. CE.SDK handles all PDF generation internally.

**Test your implementation:**

*   Open CE.SDK and create a simple design
*   Click the custom export button
*   Check browser console shows no errors
*   Verify PDF blob has `size > 0`

## Step 4: Convert to Print-Ready Format[#](#step-4-convert-to-print-ready-format)

Use the plugin to convert CE.SDK’s RGB PDF to CMYK PDF/X-3 format:

```
// Convert to print-ready PDF/X-3 formatconst printReadyPDF = await convertToPDFX3(pdfBlob, {  outputProfile: 'fogra39', // European printing standard  title: 'Print-Ready Export',});
```

**How this integrates with CE.SDK:**

*   CE.SDK exports standard RGB PDF (optimized for screens)
*   Plugin intercepts the PDF blob
*   Converts RGB colors to CMYK using professional ICC profiles
*   Adds PDF/X-3:2003 compliance markers
*   Embeds color profile for consistent printing

**Color profile selection:**

The `outputProfile` parameter determines the color space and printing standard:

*   **`'fogra39'`**: European offset printing (ISO Coated v2 ECI)
*   **`'gracol'`**: USA commercial printing (GRACoL 2013)
*   **`'srgb'`**: Digital distribution (keeps RGB)
*   **`'custom'`**: Use your own ICC profile file

Choose the profile that matches your print region or vendor requirements.

**Verify the conversion:**

1.  Conversion should complete in 2-5 seconds
2.  Output PDF is larger than input (~400-500KB for ICC profile)
3.  No error messages in console
4.  Blob size increased indicates successful conversion

## Step 5: Download Print-Ready PDF[#](#step-5-download-print-ready-pdf)

Trigger the browser download for the converted PDF:

```
// Download the print-ready PDFconst url = URL.createObjectURL(printReadyPDF);const link = document.createElement('a');link.href = url;link.download = 'design-print-ready.pdf';link.click();URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
```

**Browser download pattern explained:**

*   **`URL.createObjectURL()`**: Creates temporary URL for the Blob
*   **`document.createElement('a')`**: Creates download link element
*   **`link.click()`**: Triggers browser’s download dialog
*   **`URL.revokeObjectURL()`**: Cleans up temporary URL (prevents memory leaks)

This pattern works in all modern browsers without requiring server endpoints.

**Test the complete workflow:**

1.  Create a design in CE.SDK
2.  Click “Export Print-Ready PDF” button
3.  Browser should prompt to save file
4.  Downloaded PDF should open in PDF viewers
5.  Check file properties for PDF/X-3:2003 compliance

## Complete Implementation[#](#complete-implementation)

Here’s the full integration combining all steps:

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from '@cesdk/cesdk-js';// @ts-expect-error - Plugin types will be available in future releaseimport { convertToPDFX3 } from '@imgly/plugin-print-ready-pdfs-web';
let cesdk: CreativeEditorSDK;
const config = {  // By default, CE.SDK runs with a watermark.  // Get a free trial license at https://img.ly/forms/free-trial to remove it.  // Uncomment the line below and add your license key:  // license: 'your-license-key-here',};
async function init() {  // Initialize CE.SDK  cesdk = await CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk-container', config);
  cesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {    id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',    children: [      {        key: 'export-print-ready-pdf',        id: 'ly.img.action.navigationBar',        label: 'Export Print-Ready PDF',        iconName: '@imgly/Download',        onClick: async () => {          await exportPrintReadyPDF();        }      }    ]  });
  // Load default scene  await cesdk.createDesignScene();  await cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();  await cesdk.addDemoAssetSources();}
async function exportPrintReadyPDF() {  try {    // Check if CE.SDK is initialized    if (!cesdk) {      throw new Error('CE.SDK not initialized');    }
    // Get current scene ID    const scene = cesdk.engine.scene.get();
    if (scene == null) {      throw new Error('No scene loaded');    }
    // Get all pages in the scene    const pages = cesdk.engine.block.findByType('page');
    if (pages.length === 0) {      throw new Error('No pages found in scene');    }
    // Export first page as PDF    const pdfBlob = await cesdk.engine.block.export(pages[0], {      mimeType: 'application/pdf'    });
    // Convert to print-ready PDF/X-3 format    const printReadyPDF = await convertToPDFX3(pdfBlob, {      outputProfile: 'fogra39', // European printing standard      title: 'Print-Ready Export'    });
    // Download the print-ready PDF    const url = URL.createObjectURL(printReadyPDF);    const link = document.createElement('a');    link.href = url;    link.download = 'design-print-ready.pdf';    link.click();    URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
    console.log('Print-ready PDF exported successfully!');  } catch (error) {    console.error('Export failed:', error);    alert('Failed to export print-ready PDF. Please try again.');  }}
// Initialize when page loadsinit().catch((error) => {  console.error('Failed to initialize CE.SDK:', error);});
```

This implementation adds a complete print-ready PDF export workflow to CE.SDK with just a few lines of code.

Find the complete working example in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/imgly/cesdk-web-examples/tree/main/plugins-print-ready-pdf-browser).

## Advanced: Custom ICC Profiles[#](#advanced-custom-icc-profiles)

Use printer-specific ICC profiles:

```
// Load custom ICC profile from your serverconst customProfile = await fetch('/path/to/custom.icc').then(r => r.blob());
const printReadyPDF = await convertToPDFX3(pdfBlob, {  outputProfile: 'custom',  customProfile: customProfile,  title: 'Custom Profile Export',  outputConditionIdentifier: 'Custom_CMYK_Profile',  outputCondition: 'Custom profile for specialized printing',});
```

This allows you to meet specific print vendor requirements that may not be covered by standard profiles.

## Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting)

### ”Input must be a Blob” Error[#](#input-must-be-a-blob-error)

**Problem:** Plugin reports invalid input type

**Solution:** Ensure CE.SDK export returns a Blob:

```
const blob = await cesdk.engine.block.export(sceneId, 'application/pdf');console.log(blob instanceof Blob); // Should be trueconsole.log(blob.size); // Should be > 0
```

If `blob.size === 0`, the CE.SDK export failed. Check for scene errors.

### Converted PDF is Much Larger[#](#converted-pdf-is-much-larger)

**Problem:** Output file is significantly larger than input

**Solution:** This is expected behavior:

*   ICC profiles add ~400-500KB (FOGRA39/GRACoL)
*   Transparency flattening may rasterize content
*   For smaller files, use `srgb` profile (digital-only)
*   Disable transparency flattening if no transparency exists: `flattenTransparency: false`

### Text Becomes Rasterized[#](#text-becomes-rasterized)

**Problem:** Text appears pixelated or blurry in output

**Solution:** Transparency flattening converts transparent pages to bitmaps:

*   Avoid transparency in CE.SDK designs (use 100% opacity)
*   Don’t use alpha channel PNG images
*   Use solid fills instead of gradients with opacity
*   Or disable flattening: `flattenTransparency: false` (only if certain no transparency exists)

### Colors Look Different[#](#colors-look-different)

**Problem:** Colors appear different in exported PDF

**Solution:** This is expected when converting RGB to CMYK:

*   CMYK has a smaller color gamut than RGB
*   Some bright RGB colors cannot be reproduced in CMYK
*   Preview in CMYK-capable viewer (Adobe Acrobat) for accurate representation
*   For color-critical work, use CMYK values directly in CE.SDK designs

### Custom Button Doesn’t Appear[#](#custom-button-doesnt-appear)

**Problem:** Export button not visible in UI

**Solution:** Verify your button insertion code:

```
cesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: [    {      key: 'export-print-ready-pdf',      id: 'ly.img.action.navigationBar',      label: 'Export Print-Ready PDF',      iconName: '@imgly/Download',      onClick: async () => {        /* ... */      },    },  ],});
```

Check browser console for configuration errors. Ensure the button is added after CE.SDK initialization completes.

## Validating PDF/X-3 Compliance[#](#validating-pdfx-3-compliance)

Verify your exported PDFs meet print standards:

**Adobe Acrobat Pro:**

1.  Open converted PDF
2.  File → Properties → Description
3.  Should show “PDF version: 1.3 (PDF/X-3:2003)”
4.  File → Properties → Advanced
5.  Should show OutputIntent with ICC profile name

**Free online validators:**

*   [PDF/A-X Validator](https://www.pdf-online.com/osa/validate.aspx) - Upload and validate compliance
*   Check for PDF/X-3:2003 standard confirmation

**Command-line verification:**

Terminal window

```
# Check PDF versionpdfinfo output.pdf | grep "PDF version"
# Validate structureqpdf --check output.pdf
# Search for PDF/X markersgrep -a "PDF/X-3" output.pdf
```

# Shadows and Glows

```
// Configure a basic colored drop shadow if the block supports themif (engine.block.supportsDropShadow(block)) {  engine.block.setDropShadowEnabled(block, true);  engine.block.setDropShadowColor(block, { r: 1.0, g: 0.75, b: 0.8, a: 1.0 });  const dropShadowColor = engine.block.getDropShadowColor(block);  engine.block.setDropShadowOffsetX(block, -10);  engine.block.setDropShadowOffsetY(block, 5);  const dropShadowOffsetX = engine.block.getDropShadowOffsetX(block);  const dropShadowOffsetY = engine.block.getDropShadowOffsetY(block);  engine.block.setDropShadowBlurRadiusX(block, -10);  engine.block.setDropShadowBlurRadiusY(block, 5);  engine.block.setDropShadowClip(block, false);  const dropShadowClip = engine.block.getDropShadowClip(block);
  // Query a blocks drop shadow properties  const dropShadowIsEnabled = engine.block.isDropShadowEnabled(block);  const dropShadowBlurRadiusX = engine.block.getDropShadowBlurRadiusX(block);  const dropShadowBlurRadiusY = engine.block.getDropShadowBlurRadiusY(block);}
```

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to modify an block’s drop shadow through the `block` API. Drop shadows can be added to any shape, text or image. One can adjust its offset relative to its block on the X and Y axes, its blur factor on the X and Y axes and whether it is visible behind a transparent block.

Loading an existing scene allows resuming work on a previous session or adapting an existing template to your needs.

**Warning** Saving a scene can be done as a either _scene file_ or as an _archive file_ (c.f. Saving scenes). A _scene file_ does not include any fonts or images. Only the source URIs of assets, the general layout, and element properties are stored. When loading scenes in a new environment, ensure previously used asset URIs are available. Conversely, an _archive file_ contains within it the scene’s assets and references them as relative URIs.

## Load Scenes from a Remote URL[#](#load-scenes-from-a-remote-url)

Determine a URL that points to a scene binary string.

```
const sceneUrl =  'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v1/ly.img.template/templates/cesdk_postcard_1.scene';
```

We can then pass that string to the `engine.scene.loadFromURL(url: string): Promise<number>` function. The editor will reset and present the given scene to the user. The function is asynchronous and the returned `Promise` resolves if the scene load succeeded.

```
  const scene = await engine.scene    .loadFromURL(sceneUrl)    .then(() => {      console.log('Load succeeded');
      const text = engine.block.findByType('text')[0];      engine.block.setDropShadowEnabled(text, true);    })    .catch((error) => {      console.error('Load failed', error);    });
```

From this point on we can continue to modify our scene. In this example, assuming the scene contains a text element, we add a drop shadow to it. See [Modifying Scenes](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/) for more details.

```
const text = engine.block.findByType('text')[0];engine.block.setDropShadowEnabled(text, true);
```

Scene loads may be reverted using `cesdk.engine.editor.undo()`.

To later save your scene, see Saving Scenes.

### Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here’s the full code:

```
import CreativeEngine from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',  userId: 'guides-user',  baseURL:    'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/assets',};
CreativeEngine.init(config).then(async engine => {  // Load default assets referenced in the scene  engine.addDefaultAssetSources();
  const sceneUrl =    'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v1/ly.img.template/templates/cesdk_postcard_1.scene';
  let scene = await engine.scene    .loadFromURL(sceneUrl)    .then(() => {      console.log('Load succeeded');
      let text = engine.block.findByType('text')[0];      engine.block.setDropShadowEnabled(text, true);    })    .catch(error => {      console.error('Load failed', error);    });
  // Attach engine canvas to DOM  document.getElementById('cesdk_container').append(engine.element);});
```

## Load Scenes from a String[#](#load-scenes-from-a-string)

In this example, we fetch a scene from a remote URL and load it as a string. This string could also come from the result of `engine.scene.saveToString()`.

```
const sceneUrl =  'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v1/ly.img.template/templates/cesdk_postcard_1.scene';const sceneString = await fetch(sceneUrl).then((response) => {  return response.text();});
```

We can pass that string to the `engine.scene.loadFromString(sceneContent: string): Promise<number>)` function. The editor will then reset and present the given scene to the user. The function is asynchronous and the returned `Promise` resolves, if the scene load succeeded.

```
  const scene = await engine.scene    .loadFromString(sceneString)    .then(() => {      console.log('Load succeeded');
      const text = engine.block.findByType('text')[0];      engine.block.setDropShadowEnabled(text, true);    })    .catch((error) => {      console.error('Load failed', error);    });
```

From this point on we can continue to modify our scene. In this example, assuming the scene contains a text element, we add a drop shadow to it. See [Modifying Scenes](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/) for more details.

```
const text = engine.block.findByType('text')[0];engine.block.setDropShadowEnabled(text, true);
```

Scene loads may be reverted using `cesdk.engine.editor.undo()`.

To later save your scene, see Saving Scenes.

### Full Code[#](#full-code-1)

Here’s the full code:

```
import CreativeEngine from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',  userId: 'guides-user',  baseURL:    'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/assets',};
CreativeEngine.init(config).then(async engine => {  // Load default assets referenced in the scene  engine.addDefaultAssetSources();
  const sceneUrl =    'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v1/ly.img.template/templates/cesdk_postcard_1.scene';  const sceneString = await fetch(sceneUrl).then(response => {    return response.text();  });
  let scene = await engine.scene    .loadFromString(sceneString)    .then(() => {      console.log('Load succeeded');
      let text = engine.block.findByType('text')[0];      engine.block.setDropShadowEnabled(text, true);    })    .catch(error => {      console.error('Load failed', error);    });
  // Attach engine canvas to DOM  document.getElementById('cesdk_container').append(engine.element);});
```

## Load Scenes From a Blob[#](#load-scenes-from-a-blob)

In this example, we fetch a scene from a remote URL and load it as `sceneBlob`.

```
const sceneUrl =  'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v1/ly.img.template/templates/cesdk_postcard_1.scene';const sceneBlob = await fetch(sceneUrl).then((response) => {  return response.blob();});
```

To acquire a scene string from `sceneBlob`, we need to read its contents into a string.

```
const blobString = await sceneBlob.text();
```

We can then pass that string to the `engine.scene.loadFromString(sceneContent: string): Promise<number>` function. The editor will reset and present the given scene to the user. The function is asynchronous and the returned `Promise` resolves if the scene load succeeded.

```
  const scene = await engine.scene    .loadFromString(blobString)    .then(() => {      console.log('Load succeeded');
      const text = engine.block.findByType('text')[0];      engine.block.setDropShadowEnabled(text, true);    })    .catch((error) => {      console.error('Load failed', error);    });
```

From this point on we can continue to modify our scene. In this example, assuming the scene contains a text element, we add a drop shadow to it. See [Modifying Scenes](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/) for more details.

```
const text = engine.block.findByType('text')[0];engine.block.setDropShadowEnabled(text, true);
```

Scene loads may be reverted using `cesdk.engine.editor.undo()`.

### Full Code[#](#full-code-2)

Here’s the full code:

```
import CreativeEngine from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',  userId: 'guides-user',  baseURL:    'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/assets',};
CreativeEngine.init(config).then(async engine => {  // Load default assets referenced in the scene  engine.addDefaultAssetSources();
  const sceneUrl =    'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v1/ly.img.template/templates/cesdk_postcard_1.scene';  const sceneBlob = await fetch(sceneUrl).then(response => {    return response.blob();  });
  const blobString = await sceneBlob.text();
  let scene = await engine.scene    .loadFromString(blobString)    .then(() => {      console.log('Load succeeded');
      let text = engine.block.findByType('text')[0];      engine.block.setDropShadowEnabled(text, true);    })    .catch(error => {      console.error('Load failed', error);    });
  // Attach engine canvas to DOM  document.getElementById('cesdk_container').append(engine.element);});
```

## Loading Scene Archives[#](#loading-scene-archives)

Loading a scene archives requires unzipping the archives contents to a location, that’s accessible to the CreativeEngine. One could for example unzip the archive via `unzip archive.zip` and then serve its contents using `$ npx serve`. This spins up a local test server, that serves everything contained in the current directory at `http://localhost:3000`

The archive can then be loaded by calling `await engine.scene.loadFromURL('http://localhost:3000/scene.scene')`. See [loading scenes](nextjs/open-the-editor/load-scene-478833/) for more details. All asset paths in the archive are then resolved relative to the location of the `scene.scene` file. For an image, that would result in `'http://localhost:3000/images/1234.jpeg'`. After loading all URLs are fully resolved with the location of the `scene.scene` file and the scene behaves like any other scene.

### Resolving assets from a different source[#](#resolving-assets-from-a-different-source)

The engine will use its [URI resolver](nextjs/open-the-editor/uri-resolver-36b624/) to resolve all asset paths it encounters. This allows you to redirect requests for the assets contained in archive to a different location. To do so, you can add a custom resolver, that redirects requests for assets to a different location. Assuming you store your archived scenes in a `scenes/` directory, this would be an example of how to do so:

```
engine.editor.setURIResolver(uri => {  const url = new URL(uri);  if (    url.hostname === 'localhost' &&    url.pathname.startsWith('/scenes') &&    !url.pathname.endsWith('.scene')  ) {    // Apply custom logic here, e.g. redirect to a different server  }
  // Use default behaviour for everything else  return engine.editor.defaultURIResolver(uri);});
```

  <body>    <div id="cesdk_container" style="width: 100%; height: 100vh"></div>    <script type="module" src="index.js"></script>  </body></html>
```

In this example, we will show you how to initialize the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk) with an initial video.

Starting from an existing video allows you to use the editor for customizing individual assets. This is done by using `engine.scene.createFromVideo(url: string): Promise<number>` and passing a URL as argument.

Specify the source to use for the initial video. This can be a relative path or a remote URL.

```
await engine.scene.createFromVideo(
```

We can retrieve the graphic block id of this initial video using `cesdk.engine.block.findByType(type: ObjectType): number[]`. Note that that function returns an array. Since there’s only a single graphic block in the scene, the block is at index `0`.

```
// Find the automatically added graphic block in the scene that contains the video fill.const block = engine.block.findByType('graphic')[0];
```

We can then manipulate and modify this block. Here we modify its opacity with `cesdk.engine.block.setOpacity(id: number, opacity: number): void`. See [Modifying Scenes](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/) for more details.

```
// Change its opacity.engine.block.setOpacity(block, 0.5);
```

When starting with an initial video, the scene’s page dimensions match the given resource and the scene is configured to be in pixel design units.

To later save your scene, see Saving Scenes.

## Create a Scene From a Blob[#](#create-a-scene-from-a-blob)

In this example, we will show you how to initialize the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk) with an initial image provided from a blob.

First, get hold of a `blob` by fetching an image from the web. This is just for demonstration purposes and your `blob` object may come from a different source.

```
const blob = await fetch('https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_4.jpg').then(  (response) => response.blob());
```

Afterward, create a URL pointing to the blob via `URL.createObjectURL`.

```
const objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
```

Use the created URL as a source for the initial image.

```
const scene = await engine.scene.createFromImage(objectURL);
```

When starting with an initial image, the scenes page dimensions match the given image, and the scene is configured to be in pixel design units.

<!doctype html><html lang="en">  <head>    <meta charset="UTF-8" />    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />    <style>      body {        margin: 0;        overflow: hidden;      }      html {        overscroll-behavior-x: contain;      }    </style>  </head>

```

In this example, we will show you how to initialize the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk) with an initial image provided from a canvas.

Starting from an existing image allows you to use the editor for customizing individual assets. This is done by using `engine.scene.createFromImage(url: string, dpi = 300, pixelScaleFactor = 1): Promise<number>` and passing a URL as argument. The `dpi` argument sets the dots per inch of the scene. The `pixelScaleFactor` sets the display’s pixel scale factor.

To use the image drawn by a canvas as the initial image, acquire a `dataURL` containing the canvas contents via `canvas.toDataURL()`.

```
const dataURL = canvas.toDataURL();
```

Use the created URL as a source for the initial image.

```
const scene = await engine.scene.createFromImage(dataURL);
```

When starting with an initial image, the scenes page dimensions match the given image, and the scene is configured to be in pixel design units.

To later save your scene, see Saving Scenes.

# Start With Blank Canvas

  const page = engine.block.create('page');  engine.block.appendChild(scene, page);
  const block = engine.block.create('graphic');  engine.block.setShape(block, engine.block.createShape('star'));  engine.block.setFill(block, engine.block.createFill('color'));  engine.block.appendChild(page, block);
  // Attach engine canvas to DOM  document.getElementById('cesdk_container').append(engine.element);});
```

  <body>    <div id="cesdk_container" style="width: 100%; height: 100vh"></div>    <script type="module" src="index.js"></script>  </body></html>
```

In this example, we will show you how to initialize the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk) from scratch and add a star shape.

We create an empty scene via `engine.scene.create()` which sets up the default scene block with a camera attached. Afterwards, the scene can be populated by creating additional blocks and appending them to the scene. See [Modifying Scenes](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/) for more details.

```
const scene = await engine.scene.create();
```

We first add a page with `create(type: DesignBlockType): number` specifying a `"page"` and set a parent-child relationship between the scene and this page.

```
const page = engine.block.create('page');engine.block.appendChild(scene, page);
```

To this page, we add a graphic block, again with `create(type: DesignBlockType): number`. To make it more interesting, we set a star shape and a color fill to this block to give it a visual representation. Like for the page, we set the parent-child relationship between the page and the newly added block. From then on, modifications to this block are relative to the page.

```
const block = engine.block.create('graphic');engine.block.setShape(block, engine.block.createShape('star'));engine.block.setFill(block, engine.block.createFill('color'));engine.block.appendChild(page, block);
```

This example first appends a page child to the scene as would typically be done but it is not strictly necessary and any child block can be appended directly to a scene.

To later save your scene, see Saving Scenes.

  /** Because a custom resolver is set, relative paths that the resolver does not transform remain unmodified! */  instance.engine.editor.getAbsoluteURI('/orange.png');
  /** Removes the previously set resolver. */  instance.engine.editor.setURIResolver(null);

```

```
<!doctype html><html lang="en">  <head>    <meta charset="UTF-8" />    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />    <style>      body {        margin: 0;        overflow: hidden;      }      html {        overscroll-behavior-x: contain;      }    </style>  </head>

```

CE.SDK gives you full control over how URIs should be resolved. To register a custom resolver, use `setURIResolver` and pass in a function implementing your resolution logic. If a custom resolver is set, any URI requested by the engine is passed through the resolver. The URI your logic returns is then fetched by the engine. The resolved URI is just used for the current request and not stored. If, and only if, no custom resolver is set, the engine performs the default behaviour: absolute paths are unchanged and relative paths are prepended with the value of the `basePath` setting.

**Warning** Your custom URI resolver must return an absolute path with a scheme.

We can preview the effects of setting a custom URI resolver with the function `getAbsoluteURI`.

Before setting a custom URI resolver, the default behavior is as before and the given relative path will be prepended with the contents of `basePath`.

```
/** This will return 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/assets/banana.jpg'. */instance.engine.editor.getAbsoluteURI('/banana.jpg');
```

To show that the resolver can be fairly free-form, in this example we register a custom URI resolver that replaces all `.jpg` images with our company logo. The resolved URI are expected to be absolute.

Note: you can still access the default URI resolver by calling `defaultURIResolver(relativePath)`.

```
/** Replace all .jpg files with the IMG.LY logo! * */instance.engine.editor.setURIResolver((uri, defaultURIResolver) => {  if (uri.endsWith('.jpg')) {    return 'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/imgly_logo.jpg';  }  /** Make use of the default URI resolution behavior. */  return defaultURIResolver(uri);});
```

Given the same path as earlier, the custom resolver transforms it as specified. Note that after a custom resolver is set, relative paths that the resolver does not transform remain unmodified.

```
  /**   * The custom resolver will return a path to the IMG.LY logo because the given path ends with '.jpg'.   * This applies regardless if the given path is relative or absolute.   */  instance.engine.editor.getAbsoluteURI('/banana.jpg');
  /** The custom resolver will not modify this path because it ends with '.png'. */  instance.engine.editor.getAbsoluteURI('https://example.com/orange.png');
  /** Because a custom resolver is set, relative paths that the resolver does not transform remain unmodified! */  instance.engine.editor.getAbsoluteURI('/orange.png');
```

To remove a previously set custom resolver, call the function with a `null` value. The URI resolution is now back to the default behavior.

```
  /** Removes the previously set resolver. */  instance.engine.editor.setURIResolver(null);
  /** Since we've removed the custom resolver, this will return 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/assets/banana.jpg' like before. */  instance.engine.editor.getAbsoluteURI('/banana.jpg');
```

```

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to modify scenes layout through the `block` API.

## Layout of Blocks[#](#layout-of-blocks)

**Note on layout and frame size** The frame size is determined during the layout phase of the render process inside the engine. This means that calling `getFrameSize()` immediately after modifying the scene might return an inaccurate result.

The CreativeEngine supports three different modes for positioning blocks. These can be set for each block and both coordinates independently:

*   `'Absolute'`: the position value is interpreted in the scene’s current design unit.
*   `'Percent'`: the position value is interpreted as percentage of the block’s parent’s size, where 1.0 means 100%.
*   `'Auto'` : the position is automatically determined.

Likewise there are also three different modes for controlling a block’s size. Again both dimensions can be set independently:

*   `'Absolute'`: the size value is interpreted in the scene’s current design unit.
*   `'Percent'`: the size value is interpreted as percentage of the block’s parent’s size, where 1.0 means 100%.
*   `'Auto'` : the block’s size is automatically determined by the size of the block’s content.

Scales the block and all of its children proportionally around the specified relative anchor point. This updates the position, size and style properties (e.g. stroke width) of the block and its children. Required scope: ‘layer/resize’

*   `id`: The block that should be scaled.
*   `scale`: The scale factor to be applied to the current properties of the block.
*   `anchorX`: The relative position along the width of the block around which the scaling should occur. (0 = left edge, 0.5 = center, 1 = right edge)
*   `anchorY`: The relative position along the height of the block around which the scaling should occur. (0 = top edge, 0.5 = center, 1 = bottom edge)

### Fill a Block’s Parent[#](#fill-a-blocks-parent)

```
fillParent(id: DesignBlockId): void
```

Resize and position a block to entirely fill its parent block. The crop values of the block, except for the flip and crop rotation, are reset if it can be cropped. If the size of the block’s fill is unknown, the content fill mode is changed from `Crop` to `Cover` to prevent invalid crop values. Required scope: ‘layer/move’ - ‘layer/resize’

*   `id`: The block that should fill its parent.

### Resize Blocks Content-aware[#](#resize-blocks-content-aware)

```
resizeContentAware(ids: DesignBlockId[], width: number, height: number): void
```

Resize all blocks to the given size. The content of the blocks is automatically adjusted to fit the new dimensions. Required scope: ‘layer/resize’

Source sets allow specifying an entire set of sources, each with a different size, that should be used for drawing a block. The appropriate source is then dynamically chosen based on the current drawing size. This allows using the same scene to render a preview on a mobile screen using a small image file and a high-resolution file for print in the backend.

This guide will show you how to specify source sets both for existing blocks and when defining assets.

### Drawing[#](#drawing)

When an image needs to be drawn, the current drawing size in screen pixels is calculated and the engine looks up the most appropriate source file to draw at that resolution.

1.  If a source set is set, the source with the closest size exceeding the drawing size is used
2.  If no source set is set, the full resolution image is downscaled to a maximum edge length of 4096 (configurable via `maxImageSize` setting) and drawn to the target area

This also gives more control about up- and downsampling to you, as all intermediate resolutions can be generated using tooling of your choice.

**Source sets are also used during export of your designs and will resolve to the best matching asset for the export resolution.**

## Setup the scene[#](#setup-the-scene)

We first create a new scene with a new page.

```
document.getElementById('cesdk_container').append(engine.element);const scene = engine.scene.create();const page = engine.block.create('page');engine.block.setWidth(page, 800);engine.block.setHeight(page, 600);engine.block.appendChild(scene, page);engine.scene.zoomToBlock(page, 50, 50, 50, 50);
```

## Using a Source Set for an existing Block[#](#using-a-source-set-for-an-existing-block)

To make use of a source set for an existing image fill, we use the `setSourceSet` API. This defines a set of sources and specifies height and width for each of these sources. The engine then chooses the appropriate source during drawing. You may query an existing source set using `getSourceSet`. You can add sources to an existing source set with `addImageFileURIToSourceSet`.

```
const block = engine.block.create('graphic');engine.block.setShape(block, engine.block.createShape('rect'));const imageFill = engine.block.createFill('image');engine.block.setSourceSet(imageFill, 'fill/image/sourceSet', [  {    uri: 'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1_512x341.jpg',    width: 512,    height: 341  },  {    uri: 'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1_1024x683.jpg',    width: 1024,    height: 683  },  {    uri: 'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1_2048x1366.jpg',    width: 2048,    height: 1366  }]);engine.block.setFill(block, imageFill);console.log(engine.block.getSourceSet(imageFill, 'fill/image/sourceSet'));engine.block.appendChild(page, block);
```

## Using a Source Set in an Asset[#](#using-a-source-set-in-an-asset)

For assets, source sets can be defined in the `payload.sourceSet` field. This is directly translated to the `sourceSet` property when applying the asset. The resulting block is configured in the same way as the one described above. The code demonstrates how to add an asset that defines a source set to a local source and how `applyAsset` handles a populated `payload.sourceSet`.

```
const assetWithSourceSet = {  id: 'my-image',  meta: {    kind: 'image',    fillType: '//ly.img.ubq/fill/image'  },  payload: {    sourceSet: [      {        uri: 'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1_512x341.jpg',        width: 512,        height: 341      },      {        uri: 'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1_1024x683.jpg',        width: 1024,        height: 683      },      {        uri: 'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1_2048x1366.jpg',        width: 2048,        height: 1366      }    ]  }};
```

## Video Source Sets[#](#video-source-sets)

Source sets can also be used for video fills. This is done by setting the `sourceSet` property of the video fill. The engine will then use the source with the closest size exceeding the drawing size.

Thumbnails will use the smallest source if `features/matchThumbnailSourceToFill` is disabled, which is the default.

For low end devices or scenes with large videos, you can force the preview to always use the smallest source when editing by enabling `features/forceLowQualityVideoPreview`. On export, the highest quality source is used in any case.

```
  const videoFill = engine.block.createFill('video');  engine.block.setSourceSet(videoFill, 'fill/video/sourceSet', [    {      uri: 'https://img.ly/static/example-assets/sourceset/1x.mp4',      width: 1920,      height: 1080    }  ]);
  await engine.block.addVideoFileURIToSourceSet(    videoFill,    'fill/video/sourceSet',    'https://img.ly/static/example-assets/sourceset/2x.mp4'  );
```

# Size Limits

CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) supports importing high-resolution images, video, and audio, but there are practical limits to consider based on the user’s device capabilities.

## Image Resolution Limits[#](#image-resolution-limits)

| Constraint | Recommendation / Limit |
| --- | --- |
| **Input Resolution** | Maximum input resolution is **4096×4096 pixels**. Images from external sources (e.g., Unsplash) are resized to this size before rendering on the canvas. You can modify this value using the `maxImageSize` setting. |
| **Output Resolution** | There is no enforced output resolution limit. Theoretically, the editor supports output sizes up to **16,384×16,384 pixels**. However, practical limits depend on the device’s GPU capabilities and available memory. |

All image processing in CE.SDK is handled client-side, so these values depend on the **maximum texture size** supported by the user’s hardware. The default limit of 4096×4096 is a safe baseline that works universally. Higher resolutions (e.g., 8192×8192) may work on certain devices but could fail on others during export if the GPU texture size is exceeded.

To ensure consistent results across devices, it’s best to test higher output sizes on your target hardware and set conservative defaults in production.

## Video Resolution & Duration Limits[#](#video-resolution--duration-limits)

| Constraint | Recommendation / Limit |
| --- | --- |
| **Resolution** | Up to **4K UHD** is supported for **playback** and **export**, depending on the user’s hardware and available GPU resources. For **import**, CE.SDK does not impose artificial limits, but maximum video size is bounded by the **32-bit address space of WebAssembly (wasm32)** and the **browser tab’s memory cap (~2 GB)**. |
| **Frame Rate** | 30 FPS at 1080p is broadly supported; 60 FPS and high-res exports benefit from hardware acceleration |
| **Duration** | Stories and reels of up to **2 minutes** are fully supported. Longer videos are also supported, but we generally found a maximum duration of **10 minutes** to be a good balance for a smooth editing experience and a pleasant export duration of around one minute on modern hardware. |

Performance scales with client hardware. For best results with high-resolution or high-frame-rate video, modern CPUs/GPUs with hardware acceleration are recommended.

# Retrieve Mimetype

When working with media assets in CE.SDK, it is often necessary to determine the mimetype of a resource before processing it. This guide explains how to use the `getMimeType(uri: Uri)` function to retrieve the mimetype of a given resource.

Returns the mimetype of the resources at the given Uri.

If the resource is not already downloaded, this function will download it.

*   `uri:` the Uri of the resource.
*   Returns the mimetype of the resource.

```
// Get the mimetype of a resourceconst mimeType = await engine.editor.getMimeType(  'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v1/ly.img.image/images/sample_1.jpg',);

  engine.asset.assetSourceContentsChanged(customSource.id);
  engine.asset.removeSource(customSource.id);
  document.getElementById('cesdk_container').append(engine.element);});
```

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to manage assets through the `asset` API.

To begin working with assets first you need at least one asset source. As the name might imply asset sources provide the engine with assets. These assets then show up in the editor’s asset library. But they can also be independently searched and used to create design blocks. Asset sources can be added dynamically using the `asset` API as we will show in this guide.

## Defining a Custom Asset Source[#](#defining-a-custom-asset-source)

Asset sources need at least an `id` and a `findAssets` function. You may notice asset source functions are all `async`. This way you can use web requests or other long-running operations inside them and return results asynchronously.

Let’s go over these properties one by one:

```
const customSource = {  id: 'foobar',  async findAssets(queryData) {    return Promise.resolve({      assets: [        {          id: 'logo',          meta: {            uri: 'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/imgly_logo.jpg',            thumbUri:              'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/thumbnails/imgly_logo.jpg',            blockType: '//ly.img.ubq/image',            width: 320,            height: 116,          },          context: {            sourceId: 'foobar',          },        },      ],      total: 1,      currentPage: queryData.page,      nextPage: undefined,    });  },  async applyAsset(assetResult) {    return engine.asset.defaultApplyAsset(assetResult);  },  async applyAssetToBlock(assetResult, block) {    engine.asset.defaultApplyAssetToBlock(assetResult, block);  },};
```

All functions of the `asset` API refer to an asset source by its unique `id`. That’s why it has to be mandatory. Trying to add an asset source with an already registered `id` will fail.

```
const sourceId = 'foobar';
```

## Finding and Applying Assets[#](#finding-and-applying-assets)

The `findAssets` function should return paginated asset results for the given `queryData`. The asset results have a set of mandatory and optional properties. For a listing with an explanation for each property please refer to the [Integrate a Custom Asset Source](nextjs/import-media/from-remote-source/unsplash-8f31f0/) guide. The properties of the `queryData` and the pagination mechanism are also explained in this guide.

```
findAssets(sourceId: string, query: AssetQueryData): Promise<AssetsQueryResult<CompleteAssetResult>>
```

Finds assets of a given type in a specific asset source.

*   `sourceId`: The ID of the asset source.
*   `query`: All the options to filter the search results by.
*   Returns The search results.

The optional function ‘applyAsset’ is to define the behavior of what to do when an asset gets applied to the scene. You can use the engine’s APIs to do whatever you want with the given asset result. In this case, we always create an image block and add it to the first page we find.

If you don’t provide this function the engine’s default behavior is to create a block based on the asset result’s `meta.blockType` property, add the block to the active page, and sensibly position and size it.

```
apply(sourceId: string, assetResult: AssetResult): Promise<DesignBlockId | undefined>
```

Apply an asset result to the active scene. The default behavior will instantiate a block and configure it according to the asset’s properties. Note that this can be overridden by providing an `applyAsset` function when adding the asset source.

*   `sourceId`: The ID of the asset source.
*   `assetResult`: A single assetResult of a `findAssets` query.

```
defaultApplyAsset(assetResult: AssetResult): Promise<DesignBlockId | undefined>
```

The default implementation for applying an asset to the scene. This implementation is used when no `applyAsset` function is provided to `addSource`.

*   `assetResult`: A single assetResult of a `findAssets` query.

```
applyToBlock(sourceId: string, assetResult: AssetResult, block: DesignBlockId): Promise<void>
```

Apply an asset result to the given block.

*   `sourceId`: The ID of the asset source.
*   `assetResult`: A single assetResult of a `findAssets` query.
*   `block`: The block the asset should be applied to.

```
defaultApplyAssetToBlock(assetResult: AssetResult, block: DesignBlockId): Promise<void>
```

The default implementation for applying an asset to an existing block.

*   `assetResult`: A single assetResult of a `findAssets` query.
*   `block`: The block to apply the asset result to.

```
getSupportedMimeTypes(sourceId: string): string[]
```

Queries the list of supported mime types of the specified asset source. An empty result means that all mime types are supported.

*   `sourceId`: The ID of the asset source.

## Registering a New Asset Source[#](#registering-a-new-asset-source)

```
addSource(source: AssetSource): void
```

Adds a custom asset source. Its ID has to be unique.

*   `source`: The asset source.

```
addLocalSource(id: string, supportedMimeTypes?: string[], applyAsset?: (asset: CompleteAssetResult) => Promise<DesignBlockId | undefined>, applyAssetToBlock?: (asset: CompleteAssetResult, block: DesignBlockId) => Promise<void>): void
```

Adds a local asset source. Its ID has to be unique.

*   `source`: The asset source.
*   `supportedMimeTypes`: The mime types of assets that are allowed to be added to this local source.
*   `applyAsset`: An optional callback that can be used to override the default behavior of applying a given asset result to the active scene.
*   `applyAssetToBlock`: An optional callback that can be used to override the default behavior of applying an asset result to a given block.

```
findAllSources(): string[]
```

Finds all registered asset sources.

*   Returns A list with the IDs of all registered asset sources.

```
removeSource(id: string): void
```

Removes an asset source with the given ID.

*   `id`: The ID to refer to the asset source.

```
onAssetSourceAdded: (callback: (sourceID: string) => void) => (() => void)
```

Register a callback to be called every time an asset source is added.

*   `callback`: The function that is called whenever an asset source is added.
*   Returns A method to unsubscribe.

```
onAssetSourceRemoved: (callback: (sourceID: string) => void) => (() => void)
```

Register a callback to be called every time an asset source is removed.

*   `callback`: The function that is called whenever an asset source is added.
*   Returns A method to unsubscribe.

```
onAssetSourceUpdated: (callback: (sourceID: string) => void) => (() => void)
```

Register a callback to be called every time an asset source’s contents are changed.

*   `callback`: The function that is called whenever an asset source is updated.
*   Returns A method to unsubscribe.

## Scene Asset Sources[#](#scene-asset-sources)

A scene colors asset source is automatically available that allows listing all colors in the scene. This asset source is read-only and is updated when `findAssets` is called.

## Add an Asset[#](#add-an-asset)

```
addAssetToSource(sourceId: string, asset: AssetDefinition): void
```

Adds the given asset to a local asset source.

*   `sourceId`: The local asset source ID that the asset should be added to.
*   `asset`: The asset to be added to the asset source.

## Remove an Asset[#](#remove-an-asset)

```
removeAssetFromSource(sourceId: string, assetId: string): void
```

Removes the specified asset from its local asset source.

*   `sourceId`: The id of the local asset source that currently contains the asset.
*   `assetId`: The id of the asset to be removed.

## Asset Source Content Updates[#](#asset-source-content-updates)

If the contents of your custom asset source change, you can call the `assetSourceContentsChanged` API to later notify all subscribers of the `onAssetSourceUpdated` API.

```
assetSourceContentsChanged(sourceID: string): void
```

Notifies the engine that the contents of an asset source changed.

*   `sourceID`: The asset source whose contents changed.

## Groups in Assets[#](#groups-in-assets)

```
getGroups(id: string): Promise<string[]>
```

Queries the asset source’s groups for a certain asset type.

*   `id`: The ID of the asset source.
*   Returns The asset groups.

## Credits and License[#](#credits-and-license)

```
getCredits(sourceId: string): {        name: string;        url: string | undefined;    } | undefined
```

Queries the asset source’s credits info.

*   `sourceId`: The ID of the asset source.
*   Returns The asset source’s credits info consisting of a name and an optional URL.

```
getLicense(sourceId: string): {        name: string;        url: string | undefined;    } | undefined

# Next.js Project Without UI

Learn how to use the CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) Engine to build a **custom editing interface**, and automate design workflow entirely through code—no visual editor required.

## What’s CreativeEditor SDK?[#](#whats-creativeeditor-sdk)

CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) lets you integrate a customizable image and video editor into your web app. It includes filters, text overlays, and other media editing tools, and adapts easily to your use case.

CreativeEditor SDK is a commercial product. To use it, you need a valid license key. If you don’t have one yet, you can get a free trial or purchase a license.

[Free Trial](https://img.ly/forms/free-trial)[

Purchase License

](https://img.ly/pricing)

## Who Is This Guide For?[#](#who-is-this-guide-for)

This guide is for developers who, instead of using the default CE.SDK editor interface:

*   Want to build a **custom UI**.
*   Need to **automate design tasks** without a visual interface.
*   Have already completed a “_Getting Started with CE.SDK in Next.js_” tutorial, and are ready to explore more advanced use cases.

## What You’ll Achieve[#](#what-youll-achieve)

*   Create a client-side Next.js component that initializes the CE.SDK **headless engine**.
*   Programmatically create and edit a scene
*   Include **a custom button** that reduces the opacity of a sample image by 20% each time it’s clicked.
*   _(Optional)_ Render the CE.SDK canvas for visual feedback—while keeping full control through your custom UI.

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites)

Before you begin, make sure you have:

*   A working Next.js project.
*   Completed the “_Getting Started with CE.SDK in Next.js_” guide.
*   A valid **CE.SDK license key** ([Get a free trial](https://img.ly/forms/free-trial)).

## Step 1: Install CE.SDK Engine[#](#step-1-install-cesdk-engine)

To use CE.SDK in headless mode, install the SDK via the [`@cesdk/engine`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cesdk/engine) npm package:

Terminal window

```
npm install @cesdk/engine
```

## Step 2: Define a Custom Component for Your Headless CE.SDK Integration[#](#step-2-define-a-custom-component-for-your-headless-cesdk-integration)

Inside your Next.js `/components` folder, create a new file according to the project’s language:

Replace `<YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE>` with a **valid license key**.

[

JavaScript

](#tab-panel-34)[

TypeScript

](#tab-panel-35)

Create a file named `CustomEditor.js`, and add the following code to it:

CustomEditor.js

```
'use client';
import CreativeEngine from '@cesdk/engine';import { useEffect, useRef, useCallback } from 'react';
export default function CustomEditor() {  // Reference to store the DOM container where the CreativeEngine canvas will be attached  const canvasRef = useRef(null);  // Reference to store the CreativeEngine instance  const engineRef = useRef(null);  // Reference to store the the ID of the image block added to the scene  const imageBlockIdRef = useRef(null);
  useEffect(() => {    // Your CE.SDK configurations    const config = {      license: '<YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE>', // Replace with your license key    };
    // Initialize CreativeEngine in headless mode    CreativeEngine.init(config).then(engine => {      // To avoid initializing CreativeEngine twice in strict mode      if (!engineRef.current) {        engineRef.current = engine;
        // Append CE.SDK canvas to the DOM        if (canvasRef.current) {          canvasRef.current.appendChild(engine.element);        }
        // Get the current scene or create a new one        let scene = engine.scene.get();        if (!scene) {          scene = engine.scene.create();          const page = engine.block.create('page');          engine.block.appendChild(scene, page);        }
        // Get the first page block        const [page] = engine.block.findByType('page');
        // Append a block to show an image on the page        const imageBlockId = engine.block.create('graphic');        imageBlockIdRef.current = imageBlockId;        engine.block.setShape(imageBlockId, engine.block.createShape('rect'));
        // Fill the block with an image from a public source        const imageFill = engine.block.createFill('image');        engine.block.setSourceSet(imageFill, 'fill/image/sourceSet', [          {            uri: 'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1_1024x683.jpg',            width: 1024,            height: 683,          },        ]);        engine.block.setFill(imageBlockId, imageFill);        engine.block.appendChild(page, imageBlockId);
        // Zoom to fit the page in the editor view        engine.scene.zoomToBlock(page);      }    });  }, []);
  const changeOpacity = useCallback(() => {    const engine = engineRef.current;    const imageBlockId = imageBlockIdRef.current;
    if (engine && imageBlockId != null) {      // Get the current opacity value of the image      const currentOpacity = engine.block.getOpacity(imageBlockId);      // Reduce the opacity image by 20% at each click      engine.block.setOpacity(imageBlockId, currentOpacity * 0.8);    }  }, [engineRef, imageBlockIdRef]);
  return (    <div style={{ width: '100vw', height: '100vh', position: 'relative' }}>      <div ref={canvasRef} style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }} />      <div style={{ position: 'fixed', top: 20, left: 20 }}>        <button onClick={changeOpacity}>Reduce Opacity</button>      </div>    </div>  );}
```

Create a file named `CustomEditor.tsx`, and add the following code to it:

CustomEditor.tsx

  useEffect(() => {    // Your CE.SDK configurations    const config = {      // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY', // Replace with your license key    };
    // Initialize CreativeEngine in headless mode    CreativeEngine.init(config).then(engine => {      // To avoid initializing CreativeEngine twice in strict mode      if (!engineRef.current) {        engineRef.current = engine;
        // Append CE.SDK canvas to the DOM        if (canvasRef.current) {          canvasRef.current.appendChild(engine.element);        }
        // Get the current scene or create a new one        let scene = engine.scene.get();        if (!scene) {          scene = engine.scene.create();          const page = engine.block.create('page');          engine.block.appendChild(scene, page);        }
        // Get the first page block        const [page] = engine.block.findByType('page');
        // Append a block to show an image on the page        const imageBlockId = engine.block.create('graphic');        imageBlockIdRef.current = imageBlockId;        engine.block.setShape(imageBlockId, engine.block.createShape('rect'));
        // Fill the block with an image from a public source        const imageFill = engine.block.createFill('image');        engine.block.setSourceSet(imageFill, 'fill/image/sourceSet', [          {            uri: 'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1_1024x683.jpg',            width: 1024,            height: 683,          },        ]);        engine.block.setFill(imageBlockId, imageFill);        engine.block.appendChild(page, imageBlockId);
        // Zoom to fit the page in the editor view        engine.scene.zoomToBlock(page);      }    });  }, []);
  const changeOpacity = useCallback(() => {    const engine = engineRef.current;    const imageBlockId = imageBlockIdRef.current;
    if (engine && imageBlockId != null) {      // Get the current opacity value of the image      const currentOpacity = engine.block.getOpacity(imageBlockId);      // Reduce the opacity image by 20% at each click      engine.block.setOpacity(imageBlockId, currentOpacity * 0.8);    }  }, [engineRef, imageBlockIdRef]);
  return (    <div style={{ width: '100vw', height: '100vh', position: 'relative' }}>      <div ref={canvasRef} style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }} />      <div style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 20, left: 20 }}>        <button type="button" onClick={changeOpacity}>          Reduce Opacity        </button>      </div>    </div>  );}
```

⚠️ Always include [`"use client"`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) with your component, which uses React hooks and **browser** APIs.

Once your app initializes CreativeEngine, it allows you to programmatically create and manipulate the scene. In this example, the component includes:

*   a sample image
*   a ”Reduce Opacity” button
*   every click of the button reduces the image’s opacity by 20%

”Reduce Opacity” uses:

*   a `changeOpacity()` callback on every click
*   [CE.SDK `block` API](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/) to dynamically reduce the image’s opacity

**Note**: Visual rendering is completely optional. You can also run the engine purely in headless mode—for automation tasks like:

*   Modifying graphics
*   Generating exports

## Step 3: Create a Client-Side Editor Component[#](#step-3-create-a-client-side-editor-component)

If you attach it to the canvas, CreativeEngine requires:

*   **Browser-specific features** like `document`
*   Dynamic DOM manipulation

Because of that, the `CustomEditor`:

*   must only run on the client.
*   should never be server-side rendered (SSR).

To ensure that, load it dynamically using [Next.js’s `dynamic` import with `ssr: false`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading#with-no-ssr).

To **avoid repeating this dynamic import** in every file where you use the component, create a wrapper component named `CustomEditorNoSSR` inside your components folder.

[

JavaScript

](#tab-panel-32)[

TypeScript

](#tab-panel-33)

Create a file named `CustomEditorNoSSR.js`, and add the following code in it:

CustomEditorNoSSR.js

```
'use client';
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
const CustomEditorNoSSR = dynamic(() => import('./CustomEditor'), {  ssr: false,});
export default CustomEditorNoSSR;
```

Create a file named `CustomEditorNoSSR.tsx`, and add the following code to it:

CustomEditorNoSSR.tsx

```
'use client';
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
const CustomEditorNoSSR = dynamic(() => import('./CustomEditor'), {  ssr: false,});
export default CustomEditorNoSSR;
```

This wrapper exports the `CustomEditor` component with SSR deactivated.

## Step 4: Use the Creative Editor Component[#](#step-4-use-the-creative-editor-component)

You can import the non-SSR version of your editor like this:

```
import { default as CustomEditor } from './components/CustomEditorNoSSR';
```

Then, render it on the client by adding it to your JSX:

```
<CustomEditor />
```

Next:

1.  Start your Next.js app locally.
2.  Navigate to the page where you’ve included `<CustomEditor>`.
3.  See the a sample image in the canvas.
4.  Use the “Reduce Opacity” button to adjust the image’s opacity by 20% with each click.

## Use Cases[#](#use-cases)

Congratulations! You’ve just unlocked the foundation for more advanced use cases, such as:

*   Building fully custom user interfaces using Next.js components alongside the CE.SDK canvas.
*   Automating the generation of graphics or marketing assets directly in the browser.
*   Integrating CE.SDK into complex, multi-step creative workflows using programmatic logic.
*   Creating server-side image or video processing features with [`@cesdk/node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cesdk/node), as covered in “_Getting Started with CE.SDK in Node.js_” guide.

## Troubleshooting & Common Errors[#](#troubleshooting--common-errors)

**❌ Error**: `Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client. As a result this tree will be regenerated on the client.`

*   This warning appears only during development and **doesn’t affect production**. It’s linked to how Turbopack serves your app locally, and how CE.SDK dynamically mounts DOM elements. You can safely ignore this or suppress it by adding [`suppressHydrationWarning`](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error#solution-3-using-suppresshydrationwarning) to the affected component.

**❌ Error**: `document is not defined`

*   This means CE.SDK tried to access the browser `document` object on the server. To avoid that, ensure your app imports `CustomEditor` dynamically with `next/dynamic` and `ssr: false`, using the [`CustomEditorNoSSR` wrapper](nextjs/get-started/new-project-without-ui-k4f45q/#step-3-create-a-client-side-editor-component).

**❌ Error**: The CE.SDK canvas is rendered twice

*   Although `useEffect(..., [])` is designed to execute only once, [React might trigger a re-render in strict mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/reactStrictMode), causing the engine to load twice. Add an additional check (`if (!engineRef.current) { ... }`) to initialize the engine only if it hasn’t been loaded already.

**❌ Error**: CE.SDK canvas doesn’t render

*   Make sure that you’re appending `engine.element` to a valid DOM reference. Double-check that the reference is valid and is properly attached to the DOM element.

**❌ Error**: `Module not found: Can't resolve '@cesdk/engine``'`

*   Verify that you’ve correctly installed the CE.SDK Engine using the command `npm install @cesdk/engine`.

**❌ Error**: `Editor engine could not be loaded: The License Key (API Key) you are using to access CE.SDK is invalid`

*   Double-check that your license key is valid, hasn’t expired, and is correctly set.

**❌ The component doesn’t behave as expected**

*   Verify that your component paths and imports are correct.
*   See if `use client` is declared at the top of client components.
*   Check the browser console for specific errors.

## Next Steps[#](#next-steps)

This guide lays the foundation for:

*   [Creating a full custom UI with Next.js](nextjs/user-interface/appearance/theming-4b0938/)

# Existing Next.js Project

This guide walks you through how to integrate CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) into a Next.js project using npm and the official React wrapper component. By the end, you’ll have a fully operational CE.SDK component embedded in your Next.js app, ready for further customization.

## Who Is This Guide For?[#](#who-is-this-guide-for)

This guide is for developers who:

*   Have experience with Next.js.
*   Already have an existing Next.js project.
*   Want to integrate a powerful image and video editor into their full-stack web app.

## What You’ll Achieve[#](#what-youll-achieve)

*   Install CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) in your project using npm.
*   Set up CE.SDK in your Next.js app using the official React wrapper component with default configurations.
*   Render CE.SDK on your Next.js pages using the official React wrapper.

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites)

Before getting started, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

*   Node.js v20.12+ and npm 10+ installed on your machine. [Download the latest LTS version of Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
*   A Next.js 14+ project created with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
*   A valid **CE.SDK license key** ([Get a free trial](https://img.ly/forms/free-trial)).

## Step 1: Launch the Next.js Project Locally[#](#step-1-launch-the-nextjs-project-locally)

Start the local development server powered by [Turbopack](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/turbopack) by running the following command:

[

npm

](#tab-panel-22)[

yarn

](#tab-panel-23)[

pnpm

](#tab-panel-24)

`shell npm run dev`

`shell yarn dev`

`shell pnpm run dev`

By default, the Next.js app listens at your localhost on `http://localhost:3000/`. Open it on your browser and ensure everything works properly before proceeding.

## Step 2: Install CE.SDK[#](#step-2-install-cesdk)

Install CreativeEditor SDK by adding the [`@cesdk/cesdk-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cesdk/cesdk-js) npm package to your project’s dependencies:

[

npm

](#tab-panel-25)[

yarn

](#tab-panel-26)[

pnpm

](#tab-panel-27)

`shell npm install @cesdk/cesdk-js`

`shell yarn add @cesdk/cesdk-js`

`shell pnpm add @cesdk/cesdk-js`

## Step 3: Create Your Creative Editor Component[#](#step-3-create-your-creative-editor-component)

If you created your Next.js project using `create-next-app`, your folder structure should look like this, with components stored in the `/app/components/` directory:

```
your-nextjs-app/├── app/│   ├── components/│   │   └── ...│   ├── favicon.ico│   ├── globals.css│   ├── layout.js│   └── page.js│├── public/│   └── ...│├── .gitignore├── jsconfig.json├── next.config.mjs├── package-lock.json├── package.json├── postcss.config.mjs└── README.md
```

Inside the `components/` folder, create a new component using your project’s programming language:

[

JavaScript

](#tab-panel-30)[

TypeScript

](#tab-panel-31)

Create a new file called `CreativeEditorSDK.js` and define the following component inside it:

CreativeEditorSDK.js

```
'use client';
import CreativeEditor from '@cesdk/cesdk-js/react';
// Configure CreativeEditor SDKconst config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY', // ⚠️ REPLACE WITH YOUR ACTUAL LICENSE KEY};
// Initialization function called after SDK instance is createdconst init = async cesdk => {  // Do something with the instance of CreativeEditor SDK (e.g., populate  // the asset library with default / demo asset sources)  await Promise.all([    cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources(),    cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({      sceneMode: 'Design',      withUploadAssetSources: true,    }),  ]);
  // Create a new design scene in the editor  await cesdk.createDesignScene();};
export default function CreativeEditorSDKComponent() {  return (    // The CreativeEditor wrapper component    <CreativeEditor config={config} init={init} width="100vw" height="100vh" />  );}
```

Create a new file called `CreativeEditorSDK.tsx` and define the following component inside it:

CreativeEditorSDK.tsx

```
'use client';
import CreativeEditor from '@cesdk/cesdk-js/react';
// Configure CreativeEditor SDKconst config = {// license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY', // ⚠️ REPLACE WITH YOUR ACTUAL LICENSE KEY};
// Initialization function called after SDK instance is createdconst init = async (cesdk) => {// Do something with the instance of CreativeEditor SDK (e.g., populate// the asset library with default / demo asset sources)await Promise.all([cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources(),cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({ sceneMode: 'Design', withUploadAssetSources: true }),]);
// Create a new design scene in the editorawait cesdk.createDesignScene();};
export default function CreativeEditorSDKComponent() {  return (    // The CreativeEditor wrapper component    <CreativeEditor      config={config}      init={init}      width="100vw"      height="100vh"    />  );}
```

Always add the [`'use client'`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) directive at the top of the Creative Editor component. The component runs in the browser and uses React hooks to initialize CreativeEditor SDK.

If your project doesn’t use a `components/` folder or you store components elsewhere, you can place the `CreativeEditorSDK` file in the appropriate directory. Remember to **adjust your import paths accordingly in the next steps**.

## Step 4: Use the Creative Editor Component[#](#step-4-use-the-creative-editor-component)

Import the `CreativeEditorSDKComponent` in your pages. For example, a `page.js`/`page.tsx` that integrates the Creative Editor component might contain:

[

JavaScript

](#tab-panel-28)[

TypeScript

](#tab-panel-29)

page.js

```
import CreativeEditorSDKComponent from './components/CreativeEditorSDK';
export default function Home() {  return (    <>      {/* Other components.. */}      <CreativeEditorSDKComponent />      {/* Other components.. */}    </>  );}
```

page.tsx

```
import CreativeEditorSDKComponent from './components/CreativeEditorSDK';
export default function Home() {  return (    <>      {/* Other components.. */}      <CreativeEditorSDKComponent />      {/* Other components.. */}    </>  );}
```

## Step 5: Test the Integration[#](#step-5-test-the-integration)

1.  Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.
2.  A fully functional CE.SDK editor should appear.

## Troubleshooting & Common Errors[#](#troubleshooting--common-errors)

**❌ Error**: `Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client. As a result this tree will be regenerated on the client.`

*   This issue appears during development because Turbopack pre-renders pages on the server before the browser executes any client-side logic. It doesn’t affect production builds. You can safely ignore it or suppress it using [`suppressHydrationWarning`](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error#solution-3-using-suppresshydrationwarning).

**❌ Error**: `Identifier 'CreativeEditorSDK' has already been declared`

*   Ensure that the name of your custom creative editor component function isn’t `CreativeEditor`, as that conflicts with the component imported from `@cesdk/cesdk-js/react`.

**❌ Error**: `The following dependencies are imported but could not be resolved: @cesdk/cesdk-js`

*   Check that the CE.SDK package is properly installed by running `npm install @cesdk/cesdk-js`.

**❌ Error**: `Editor engine could not be loaded: The License Key (API Key) you are using to access CE.SDK is invalid`

*   Ensure that your license key is valid and hasn’t expired.

**❌ Editor does not load**

*   Open the browser console and inspect any error messages.
*   Double-check your import paths and component locations for typos or incorrect structure.

## Next Steps[#](#next-steps)

# New Next.js Project

This guide shows you how to set up a **new Next.js project**, and integrate the CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) using the official React wrapper component. You’ll learn how to install CE.SDK via npm, create a reusable editor component, and embed it cleanly into your app, ready for customization.

## Who Is This Guide For?[#](#who-is-this-guide-for)

This guide is for developers who:

*   Have basic experience with Next.js.
*   Want to start a new Next.js project.
*   Want to build a page in their app that includes a fully featured image and video editor client-side component.

## What You’ll Achieve[#](#what-youll-achieve)

*   Initialize a new Next.js project using `create-next-app`.
*   Install the CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) via **npm**.
*   Create a custom Creative Editor **component** with default settings using the official React wrapper.
*   Use CE.SDK in your Next.js pages.

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites)

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

*   Node.js v20.12+ and npm 10+ installed on your machine. [Download the latest LTS version of Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
*   A valid **CE.SDK license key** ([Get a free trial](https://img.ly/forms/fr-trial)).

## Step 1: Set Up a New Next.js Project[#](#step-1-set-up-a-new-nextjs-project)

To create a new blank Next.js project called `my-nextjs-app`, run the following command:

Terminal window

```
npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app
```

The CLI prompts you with a few questions. Choose:

*   Default options.
*   **JavaScript** as programming language instead of TypeScript.

The CLI creates a new Next.js project in the `my-nextjs-app` folder. Navigate into the project folder in the terminal:

Terminal window

```
cd my-nextjs-app
```

Below is the file structure the Next.js project folder should contain:

```
my-nextjs-app/├── app/                # Application source code│   ├── favicon.ico     # Application favicon│   ├── globals.css     # Global styles│   ├── layout.js       # Main layout component│   └── page.js         # Main page component│├── public/              # Static assets│   ├── file.svg        # Sample SVG file│   ├── globe.svg       # Globe SVG asset│   ├── next.svg        # Next.js logo SVG│   ├── vercel.svg      # Vercel logo SVG│   └── window.svg      # Window SVG asset│├── .gitignore          # Git ignore file├── jsconfig.json       # JavaScript configuration file├── next.config.mjs     # Next.js configuration file├── package-lock.json   # Lock file for package dependencies├── package.json        # Project dependencies and scripts├── postcss.config.mjs  # PostCSS configuration file└── README.md           # Project README file
```

Install dependencies with:

Terminal window

```
npm install
```

## Step 2: Install CE.SDK[#](#step-2-install-cesdk)

Install the CreativeEditor SDK by adding the [`@cesdk/cesdk-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cesdk/cesdk-js) npm package to your project’s dependencies:

Terminal window

```
npm install @cesdk/cesdk-js
```

## Step 3: Run the Next.js Project Locally[#](#step-3-run-the-nextjs-project-locally)

Run your project locally by starting the development server with:

Terminal window

```
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the starter Next.js app in your browser.

## Step 4: Create Your Creative Editor Component[#](#step-4-create-your-creative-editor-component)

In your new codebase, add a `components/` folder to the `app/` folder of your new Next.js project:

```
app/ ├── components/ # the new folder ├── ... └── page.js
```

Inside the `components/` folder, create a new file named `CreativeEditorSDK.js` defining the following component:

CreativeEditorSDK.js

```
'use client';
import CreativeEditor from '@cesdk/cesdk-js/react';
// Configure CreativeEditor SDKconst config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY', // replace with a valid CE.SDK license key};
// initialization function called after SDK instance is createdconst init = async cesdk => {  // do something with the instance of CreativeEditor SDK (e.g., populate  // the asset library with default / demo asset sources)  await Promise.all([    cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources(),    cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({      sceneMode: 'Design',      withUploadAssetSources: true,    }),  ]);
  // create a new design scene in the editor  await cesdk.createDesignScene();};
export default function CreativeEditorSDKComponent() {  return (    // The CreativeEditor wrapper component    <CreativeEditor config={config} init={init} width="100vw" height="100vh" />  );}
```

Always add [`"use client"`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) directive at the top of your custom Creative Editor component. It runs in the browser and uses React hooks to initialize the SDK.

## Step 5: Use the Creative Editor Component[#](#step-5-use-the-creative-editor-component)

Import `CreativeEditorSDKComponent` in your `page.js` file and use it in your page:

page.js

```
import CreativeEditorSDKComponent from './components/CreativeEditorSDK';
export default function Home() {  return (    <>      {/* Other components.. */}      <CreativeEditorSDKComponent />      {/* Other components.. */}    </>  );}
```

## Step 6: Test the Integration[#](#step-6-test-the-integration)

1.  Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.
2.  A fully functional CE.SDK editor should appear.

## Troubleshooting & Common Errors[#](#troubleshooting--common-errors)

**❌ Error**: `Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client. As a result this tree will be regenerated on the client.`

*   This error only occurs during development due to how the local Turbopack development server works and how CreativeEditor SDK dynamically manipulates the DOM to mount the editor in the browser. In production, this error won’t appear, so you can either safely ignore it or suppress it with [`suppressHydrationWarning`](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error#solution-3-using-suppresshydrationwarning).

**❌ Error**: `Identifier 'CreativeEditorSDK' has already been declared`

Understanding the distinction between **video fills** and **video blocks** is essential. Video fills are fill objects that can be applied to any block supporting fills—shapes, text, backgrounds—to paint them with video content. Video blocks, created with `addVideo()`, are dedicated timeline elements with full editing capabilities like trimming and duration control. Video fills focus on applying video as a visual treatment, while video blocks provide complete video editing functionality.

This guide covers how to create video fills, apply them to blocks, configure fill modes, and work with video resources programmatically.

## Understanding Video Fills[#](#understanding-video-fills)

### What is a Video Fill?[#](#what-is-a-video-fill)

A video fill is a fill object that paints a design block with video content. Like color and image fills, video fills are part of CE.SDK’s broader fill system.

Video fills are identified by the type `'//ly.img.ubq/fill/video'` or the short form `'video'`. They contain properties for the video source, positioning, scaling, and playback behavior.

### Video Fill vs Video Blocks[#](#video-fill-vs-video-blocks)

**Video fills** are fill objects created with `createFill('video')` and applied to blocks with `setFill()`. You can use them to fill shapes with video content, create video backgrounds, or add video textures to text.

**Video blocks** are created with the convenience method `addVideo()` and come pre-configured with timeline integration, trim support, and playback controls. Use video blocks when building video editors or when you need features like trimming, duration adjustment, and precise playback control.

For this guide, we focus on video fills—applying video content as a fill to design elements. For video editing workflows, see the [Trim Video guide](../../../create-video/trim+4f688b/).

### Video Mode Requirement[#](#video-mode-requirement)

Video fills can only be created in Video mode scenes. Design mode doesn’t support video fills. You must initialize CE.SDK with `createVideoScene()` instead of `createDesignScene()`.

```
// Create Video mode scene (required for video fills)await cesdk.createVideoScene();
// Verify scene modeconst mode = engine.scene.getMode();console.log(mode); // "Video"
```

## Checking Video Fill Support[#](#checking-video-fill-support)

Before applying video fills, verify that blocks support fills and that you’re in the correct scene mode.

```
    // Create a sample block to demonstrate fill support checking    const sampleBlock = engine.block.create('graphic');    engine.block.setShape(sampleBlock, engine.block.createShape('rect'));
    // Check if the block supports fills    const supportsFills = engine.block.supportsFill(sampleBlock);    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log('Block supports fills:', supportsFills); // true for graphic blocks
    // Verify we're in Video mode (required for video fills)    const sceneMode = engine.scene.getMode();    if (sceneMode !== 'Video') {      throw new Error('Video fills require Video mode.');    }    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log('Scene mode:', sceneMode); // "Video"
```

Graphic blocks, shapes, and text blocks typically support fills. Pages and scenes don’t. Always check `supportsFill()` before attempting to apply video fills to prevent errors.

## Creating Video Fills[#](#creating-video-fills)

### Creating Video Fills[#](#creating-video-fills-1)

Creating a video fill involves three steps: create the fill object, set the video source, and apply it to a block.

```
    // Pattern #1: Demonstrate Individual Before Combined    // Create a basic video fill demonstration    const basicBlock = engine.block.create('graphic');    engine.block.setShape(basicBlock, engine.block.createShape('rect'));    engine.block.setWidth(basicBlock, blockWidth);    engine.block.setHeight(basicBlock, blockHeight);    engine.block.appendChild(page, basicBlock);
    // Create a video fill    const basicVideoFill = engine.block.createFill('video');    // or using full type name: engine.block.createFill('//ly.img.ubq/fill/video');
    // Set the video source URI    engine.block.setString(basicVideoFill, 'fill/video/fileURI', videoUri);
    // Apply the fill to the block    engine.block.setFill(basicBlock, basicVideoFill);
```

The video fill exists independently until you attach it to a block. This allows you to configure the fill completely before applying it. Once applied, the fill paints the block with the video content.

### Getting Current Fill Information[#](#getting-current-fill-information)

We can retrieve the current fill from a block and inspect its type to verify it’s a video fill.

```
// Get and verify the current fillconst fillId = engine.block.getFill(basicBlock);const fillType = engine.block.getType(fillId);// eslint-disable-next-line no-consoleconsole.log('Fill type:', fillType); // '//ly.img.ubq/fill/video'
```

This is useful when building UIs that need to adapt based on the current fill type or when implementing undo/redo functionality that tracks fill changes.

## Content Fill Modes[#](#content-fill-modes)

Content fill modes control how video scales and positions within blocks. The two primary modes are Cover and Contain, each suited to different use cases.

### Cover Mode[#](#cover-mode)

Cover mode fills the entire block with video while maintaining the video’s aspect ratio. If the aspect ratios don’t match, CE.SDK crops portions of the video to ensure no empty space appears in the block.

```
    // Pattern #2: Content fill mode - Cover    // Cover mode fills entire block, may crop video to fit    const coverBlock = engine.block.create('graphic');    engine.block.setShape(coverBlock, engine.block.createShape('rect'));    engine.block.setWidth(coverBlock, blockWidth);    engine.block.setHeight(coverBlock, blockHeight);    engine.block.appendChild(page, coverBlock);
    const coverVideoFill = engine.block.createFill('video');    engine.block.setString(coverVideoFill, 'fill/video/fileURI', videoUri);    engine.block.setFill(coverBlock, coverVideoFill);
    // Set content fill mode to Cover    engine.block.setEnum(coverBlock, 'contentFill/mode', 'Cover');
    // Get current fill mode    const coverMode = engine.block.getEnum(coverBlock, 'contentFill/mode');    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log('Cover block fill mode:', coverMode); // 'Cover'
```

Use Cover mode for background videos, full-frame video content, and situations where visual consistency matters more than showing the entire video. It guarantees no empty space but may crop content.

### Contain Mode[#](#contain-mode)

Contain mode fits the entire video within the block while maintaining aspect ratio. If aspect ratios don’t match, CE.SDK adds empty space to preserve the full video visibility.

```
    // Content fill mode - Contain    // Contain mode fits entire video, may leave empty space    const containBlock = engine.block.create('graphic');    engine.block.setShape(containBlock, engine.block.createShape('rect'));    engine.block.setWidth(containBlock, blockWidth);    engine.block.setHeight(containBlock, blockHeight);    engine.block.appendChild(page, containBlock);
    const containVideoFill = engine.block.createFill('video');    engine.block.setString(containVideoFill, 'fill/video/fileURI', videoUri);    engine.block.setFill(containBlock, containVideoFill);
    // Set content fill mode to Contain    engine.block.setEnum(containBlock, 'contentFill/mode', 'Contain');
```

Use Contain mode when the entire video must remain visible—presentations, product demos, or content where cropping would lose important information. Empty space is acceptable to preserve complete visibility.

## Loading Video Resources[#](#loading-video-resources)

Before accessing video metadata like duration or dimensions, you must force load the video resource. This ensures CE.SDK has downloaded the necessary information.

```
    // Force load video resource to access metadata    const resourceBlock = engine.block.create('graphic');    engine.block.setShape(resourceBlock, engine.block.createShape('rect'));    engine.block.setWidth(resourceBlock, blockWidth);    engine.block.setHeight(resourceBlock, blockHeight);    engine.block.appendChild(page, resourceBlock);
    const resourceVideoFill = engine.block.createFill('video');    engine.block.setString(resourceVideoFill, 'fill/video/fileURI', videoUri);    engine.block.setFill(resourceBlock, resourceVideoFill);
    // Force load the video resource before accessing metadata    await engine.block.forceLoadAVResource(resourceVideoFill);
    // Now we can access video metadata    const totalDuration = engine.block.getDouble(      resourceVideoFill,      'fill/video/totalDuration'    );    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log('Video total duration:', totalDuration, 'seconds');
```

Skipping this step causes errors when trying to access metadata. Videos load asynchronously, so `forceLoadAVResource` ensures the metadata is available before you query it.

Once loaded, you can access properties like `fill/video/totalDuration` to get the video length in seconds. This information helps you build UI previews or validate user input.

## Common Use Cases[#](#common-use-cases)

### Video as Shape Fill[#](#video-as-shape-fill)

Video fills aren’t limited to rectangles. You can fill any shape with video content.

```
    // Use case: Video as shape fill - Ellipse    const ellipseBlock = engine.block.create('graphic');    const ellipseShape = engine.block.createShape('//ly.img.ubq/shape/ellipse');    engine.block.setShape(ellipseBlock, ellipseShape);    engine.block.setWidth(ellipseBlock, blockWidth);    engine.block.setHeight(ellipseBlock, blockHeight);    engine.block.appendChild(page, ellipseBlock);
    const ellipseVideoFill = engine.block.createFill('video');    engine.block.setString(ellipseVideoFill, 'fill/video/fileURI', videoUri);    engine.block.setFill(ellipseBlock, ellipseVideoFill);
```

Ellipse shapes, polygons, stars, and custom paths all support video fills. The video content fills the shape boundary, masking the video.

### Video with Opacity[#](#video-with-opacity)

Control the transparency of video-filled blocks to create overlay effects or blend video content with backgrounds.

```
    // Advanced: Video fill with opacity    const opacityBlock = engine.block.create('graphic');    engine.block.setShape(opacityBlock, engine.block.createShape('rect'));    engine.block.setWidth(opacityBlock, blockWidth);    engine.block.setHeight(opacityBlock, blockHeight);    engine.block.appendChild(page, opacityBlock);
    const opacityVideoFill = engine.block.createFill('video');    engine.block.setString(opacityVideoFill, 'fill/video/fileURI', videoUri);    engine.block.setFill(opacityBlock, opacityVideoFill);
    // Set block opacity to 70%    engine.block.setFloat(opacityBlock, 'opacity', 0.7);
```

Opacity affects the entire block, including its video fill. This technique creates semi-transparent video overlays, watermarks, or layered compositions where video content blends with other elements.

## Additional Techniques[#](#additional-techniques)

### Sharing Video Fills[#](#sharing-video-fills)

Memory efficiency improves when multiple blocks share a single video fill instance. Changes to the shared fill affect all blocks using it.

```
    // Advanced: Share one video fill between multiple blocks    const sharedFill = engine.block.createFill('video');    engine.block.setString(sharedFill, 'fill/video/fileURI', videoUri);
    // First block using shared fill    const sharedBlock1 = engine.block.create('graphic');    engine.block.setShape(sharedBlock1, engine.block.createShape('rect'));    engine.block.setWidth(sharedBlock1, blockWidth);    engine.block.setHeight(sharedBlock1, blockHeight);    engine.block.appendChild(page, sharedBlock1);    engine.block.setFill(sharedBlock1, sharedFill);
    // Second block using the same shared fill    const sharedBlock2 = engine.block.create('graphic');    engine.block.setShape(sharedBlock2, engine.block.createShape('rect'));    engine.block.setWidth(sharedBlock2, blockWidth * 0.8); // Slightly smaller    engine.block.setHeight(sharedBlock2, blockHeight * 0.8);    engine.block.appendChild(page, sharedBlock2);    engine.block.setFill(sharedBlock2, sharedFill);
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log(      'Shared fill - Two blocks using the same video fill instance for memory efficiency'    );
```

This pattern reduces memory usage when the same video appears multiple times in a composition. It’s particularly useful for repeated elements like watermarks or background patterns.

Shared fills play back synchronized—all blocks display the same frame at the same time during playback. This ensures visual consistency across multiple elements.

## Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting)

### Video Not Visible[#](#video-not-visible)

If your video fill doesn’t appear, check several common causes. Verify the fill is enabled with `isFillEnabled(block)`. Ensure the video URL is accessible—CORS restrictions on web platforms can block video loading. Confirm the block has valid dimensions (width and height greater than zero) and exists in the scene hierarchy.

Check that the video format is supported on your platform. MP4 with H.264 encoding works reliably across platforms, while other codecs may have limited support.

### Cannot Create Video Fill[#](#cannot-create-video-fill)

If creating a video fill throws an error, verify you’re in Video mode. Design mode doesn’t support video fills. Use `engine.scene.getMode()` to check the current mode. If it returns “Design”, you need to create a video scene instead.

Call `await cesdk.createVideoScene()` during initialization rather than `createDesignScene()` to enable video capabilities.

### Video Not Loading[#](#video-not-loading)

When videos fail to load, verify network connectivity for remote URLs. Check CORS headers—web browsers enforce cross-origin restrictions that can block video access. Validate the URI format uses `https://` for remote videos or appropriate schemes for local files.

Test with a known working video URL to isolate whether the issue is with your specific video or a broader configuration problem. Check the browser console for detailed error messages.

### Memory Leaks[#](#memory-leaks)

Always destroy replaced fills to prevent memory leaks. When changing a block’s fill, retrieve the old fill with `getFill()`, assign the new fill with `setFill()`, then destroy the old fill with `destroy()`.

Don’t create fills without attaching them to blocks—unattached fills remain in memory indefinitely. Clean up shared fills when no blocks reference them anymore.

### Performance Issues[#](#performance-issues)

Video playback is resource-intensive. Use appropriately sized videos—avoid massive files that strain decoding hardware. Consider lower resolutions for editing with high-resolution sources reserved for export.

Limit the number of simultaneously playing videos, especially on mobile devices. Too many concurrent video decodes overwhelm device capabilities. Compress videos before use to reduce file sizes and improve loading times.

Image fills paint design blocks with raster or vector image content, supporting various formats including PNG, JPEG, WebP, and SVG. You can load images from remote URLs, local files, data URIs, and asset libraries, with built-in support for responsive images through source sets and multiple content fill modes for flexible positioning.

export default Example;
```

This guide covers how to create and apply image fills programmatically, configure content fill modes, work with responsive images, and load images from different sources.

## Understanding Image Fills[#](#understanding-image-fills)

Image fills are one of the fundamental fill types in CE.SDK, identified by the type `'//ly.img.ubq/fill/image'` or simply `'image'`. Unlike color fills that provide solid colors or gradient fills that create color transitions, image fills paint blocks with photographic or graphic content from image files.

CE.SDK supports common image formats including PNG, JPEG, JPG, GIF, WebP, SVG, and BMP, with transparency support in formats like PNG, WebP, and SVG. The image fill system handles content scaling, positioning, and optimization automatically while giving you full programmatic control when needed.

## Checking Image Fill Support[#](#checking-image-fill-support)

Before working with fills, we should verify that a block supports fill operations. Not all blocks in CE.SDK can have fills—for example, scenes and pages typically don’t support fills, while graphic blocks, shapes, and text blocks do.

```
// Check if a block supports fills before accessing fill APIsconst testBlock = engine.block.create('graphic');const canHaveFill = engine.block.supportsFill(testBlock);console.log('Block supports fills:', canHaveFill);engine.block.destroy(testBlock);
```

The `supportsFill()` method returns `true` if the block can have a fill assigned to it. Always check this before attempting to access fill APIs to avoid errors.

## Creating Image Fills[#](#creating-image-fills)

CE.SDK provides two approaches for creating image fills: a convenience API for quick block creation, and manual creation for more control over the fill configuration.

### Using the Convenience API[#](#using-the-convenience-api)

The fastest way to create a block with an image fill is using the `addImage()` method, which creates a graphic block, configures the image fill, and adds it to the scene in one operation:

```
// Create a new image fill using the convenience APIconst coverImageBlock = await engine.block.addImage(imageUri, {  size: blockSize});engine.block.appendChild(page, coverImageBlock);
```

This convenience method handles all the underlying setup automatically, including creating the graphic block, shape, fill, and positioning.

### Manual Image Fill Creation[#](#manual-image-fill-creation)

For more control over the fill configuration or to apply fills to existing blocks, you can create fills manually:

```
    // Or create manually for more control    const manualBlock = engine.block.create('graphic');    engine.block.setShape(manualBlock, engine.block.createShape('rect'));    engine.block.setWidth(manualBlock, blockWidth);    engine.block.setHeight(manualBlock, blockHeight);
    const imageFill = engine.block.createFill('image');    engine.block.setString(      imageFill,      'fill/image/imageFileURI',      'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_2.jpg'    );    engine.block.setFill(manualBlock, imageFill);    engine.block.appendChild(page, manualBlock);
```

When creating fills manually, the fill exists independently until you attach it to a block using `setFill()`. If you create a fill but don’t attach it to a block, you must destroy it manually to avoid memory leaks.

### Getting the Current Fill[#](#getting-the-current-fill)

You can retrieve the fill from any block and inspect its type to verify it’s an image fill:

```
// Get the current fill from a blockconst currentFill = engine.block.getFill(coverImageBlock);const fillType = engine.block.getType(currentFill);console.log('Fill type:', fillType); // '//ly.img.ubq/fill/image'
```

The `getFill()` method returns the fill’s block ID, which you can then use to query the fill’s type and properties.

## Configuring Content Fill Modes[#](#configuring-content-fill-modes)

Content fill modes control how images scale and position within their containing blocks. CE.SDK provides two primary modes: Cover and Contain, each optimized for different use cases.

### Cover Mode[#](#cover-mode)

Cover mode ensures the image fills the entire block while maintaining its aspect ratio. Parts of the image may be cropped if the aspect ratios don’t match, but there will never be empty space in the block:

```
// Cover mode: Fill entire block, may crop imageconst coverBlock = await engine.block.addImage(  'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_3.jpg',  {    size: blockSize  });engine.block.appendChild(page, coverBlock);engine.block.setEnum(coverBlock, 'contentFill/mode', 'Cover');
```

Cover mode is ideal for backgrounds, hero images, and photo frames where you want the block completely filled with image content. The image is scaled to cover the entire area, and any overflow is cropped.

### Contain Mode[#](#contain-mode)

Contain mode fits the entire image within the block while maintaining its aspect ratio. This may leave empty space if the aspect ratios don’t match, but the entire image will always be visible:

```
// Contain mode: Fit entire image, may leave empty spaceconst containBlock = await engine.block.addImage(  'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_4.jpg',  {    size: blockSize  });engine.block.appendChild(page, containBlock);engine.block.setEnum(containBlock, 'contentFill/mode', 'Contain');
```

Contain mode is best for logos, product images, and situations where preserving the complete image visibility is more important than filling the entire block.

### Getting the Current Fill Mode[#](#getting-the-current-fill-mode)

You can query the current fill mode to understand how the image is being displayed:

```
// Get current fill modeconst currentMode = engine.block.getEnum(containBlock, 'contentFill/mode');console.log('Current fill mode:', currentMode);
```

This returns either `'Cover'` or `'Contain'` depending on the current configuration.

## Working with Source Sets[#](#working-with-source-sets)

Source sets enable responsive images by providing multiple resolutions of the same image. The engine automatically selects the most appropriate size based on the current display context, optimizing both performance and visual quality.

### Setting Up a Source Set[#](#setting-up-a-source-set)

A source set is an array of image sources, each with a URI and dimensions:

```
    // Use source sets for responsive images    const responsiveBlock = engine.block.create('graphic');    engine.block.setShape(responsiveBlock, engine.block.createShape('rect'));    engine.block.setWidth(responsiveBlock, blockWidth);    engine.block.setHeight(responsiveBlock, blockHeight);
    const responsiveFill = engine.block.createFill('image');    engine.block.setSourceSet(responsiveFill, 'fill/image/sourceSet', [      {        uri: 'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1.jpg',        width: 512,        height: 341      },      {        uri: 'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1.jpg',        width: 1024,        height: 683      },      {        uri: 'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1.jpg',        width: 2048,        height: 1366      }    ]);    engine.block.setFill(responsiveBlock, responsiveFill);    engine.block.appendChild(page, responsiveBlock);
```

Each entry in the source set specifies a URI and the image’s width and height in pixels. The engine calculates the current drawing size and selects the source with the closest size that exceeds the required dimensions.

Source sets are particularly valuable for optimizing bandwidth usage during preview while ensuring high-resolution output during export. The engine automatically uses the highest resolution available when exporting.

### Retrieving Source Sets[#](#retrieving-source-sets)

You can get the current source set from a fill to inspect or modify it:

```
// Get current source setconst sourceSet = engine.block.getSourceSet(  responsiveFill,  'fill/image/sourceSet');console.log('Source set entries:', sourceSet.length);
```

## Loading Images from Different Sources[#](#loading-images-from-different-sources)

CE.SDK’s image fills support multiple image source types, giving you flexibility in how you provide image content to your designs.

### Data URIs and Base64[#](#data-uris-and-base64)

You can embed image data directly using data URIs, which is particularly useful for small images, icons, or dynamically generated graphics:

```
    // Use data URI for embedded images (small SVG example)    const svgContent = `<svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="#4CAF50"/>        <text x="50" y="55" text-anchor="middle" fill="white" font-size="20" font-weight="bold">SVG</text>      </svg>`;    const svgDataUri = `data:image/svg+xml;base64,${btoa(svgContent)}`;
    const dataUriBlock = engine.block.create('graphic');    engine.block.setShape(dataUriBlock, engine.block.createShape('rect'));    engine.block.setWidth(dataUriBlock, blockWidth);    engine.block.setHeight(dataUriBlock, blockHeight);
    const dataUriFill = engine.block.createFill('image');    engine.block.setString(dataUriFill, 'fill/image/imageFileURI', svgDataUri);    engine.block.setFill(dataUriBlock, dataUriFill);    engine.block.appendChild(page, dataUriBlock);
```

Data URIs embed the entire image within the URI string itself, eliminating the need for network requests. However, this increases the scene file size, so it’s best reserved for smaller images or cases where you need guaranteed availability without network dependencies.

## Additional Techniques[#](#additional-techniques)

### Sharing Image Fills Between Blocks[#](#sharing-image-fills-between-blocks)

A single fill instance can be shared between multiple blocks, providing memory efficiency and synchronized updates:

```
    // Create one fill and share it between multiple blocks    const sharedFill = engine.block.createFill('image');    engine.block.setString(      sharedFill,      'fill/image/imageFileURI',      'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_5.jpg'    );
    // Apply to first block    const sharedBlock1 = engine.block.create('graphic');    engine.block.setShape(sharedBlock1, engine.block.createShape('rect'));    engine.block.setWidth(sharedBlock1, blockWidth);    engine.block.setHeight(sharedBlock1, blockHeight);    engine.block.setFill(sharedBlock1, sharedFill);    engine.block.appendChild(page, sharedBlock1);
    // Apply to second block (shares the same fill)    const sharedBlock2 = engine.block.create('graphic');    engine.block.setShape(sharedBlock2, engine.block.createShape('rect'));    engine.block.setWidth(sharedBlock2, blockWidth);    engine.block.setHeight(sharedBlock2, blockHeight);    engine.block.setFill(sharedBlock2, sharedFill);    engine.block.appendChild(page, sharedBlock2);
```

When you modify a shared fill—for example, changing the image URI or adjusting properties—the changes automatically apply to all blocks using that fill. This is memory-efficient for repeated images and ensures consistency across multiple instances.

### Controlling Opacity[#](#controlling-opacity)

You can control the overall opacity of blocks with image fills, affecting the entire block including its fill:

```
// Control opacity for transparency effectsconst opacityBlock = await engine.block.addImage(  'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_6.jpg',  {    size: blockSize  });engine.block.appendChild(page, opacityBlock);engine.block.setFloat(opacityBlock, 'opacity', 0.6);
```

The opacity value ranges from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque). This affects the entire block, including the image fill. For transparency within the image itself, use image formats that support alpha channels like PNG, WebP, or SVG.

Opacity is a block property, not a fill property. It affects the entire block including any strokes, effects, or other visual properties applied to the block.

Color fills are one of the fundamental fill types in CE.SDK, allowing you to paint design blocks with solid, uniform colors. Unlike gradient fills that transition between colors or image fills that display photo content, color fills apply a single color across the entire block. The color fill system supports multiple color spaces including RGB for screen display, CMYK for print workflows, and Spot Colors for brand consistency.

This guide demonstrates how to create, apply, and modify color fills programmatically, work with different color spaces, and manage fill properties for various design elements.

## Understanding Color Fills[#](#understanding-color-fills)

### What is a Color Fill?[#](#what-is-a-color-fill)

A color fill is a fill object identified by the type `'//ly.img.ubq/fill/color'` (or its shorthand `'color'`) that paints a design block with a single, uniform color. Color fills are part of the broader fill system in CE.SDK and contain a `fill/color/value` property that defines the actual color using various color space formats.

Color fills differ from other fill types available in CE.SDK:

*   **Color fills**: Solid, uniform color across the entire block
*   **Gradient fills**: Color transitions (linear, radial, conical)
*   **Image fills**: Photo or raster content
*   **Video fills**: Animated video content

### Supported Color Spaces[#](#supported-color-spaces)

CE.SDK’s color fill system supports multiple color spaces to accommodate different design and production workflows:

*   **RGB/sRGB**: Red, Green, Blue with alpha channel (standard for screen display)
*   **CMYK**: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key (black) with tint (for print production)
*   **Spot Colors**: Named colors with RGB/CMYK approximations (for brand consistency)

Each color space serves specific use cases—use RGB for digital designs, CMYK for print-ready content, and Spot Colors to maintain brand standards across projects.

## Checking Color Fill Support[#](#checking-color-fill-support)

### Verifying Block Compatibility[#](#verifying-block-compatibility)

Before applying color fills to a block, verify that the block type supports fills. Not all block types can have fills—for example, scene and page blocks typically don’t support fills.

```
// Check if block supports fillsconst canHaveFill = engine.block.supportsFill(block);if (!canHaveFill) {  throw new Error('Block does not support fills');}
```

Graphic blocks, shapes, and text blocks typically support fills. Always check `supportsFill()` before accessing fill APIs to avoid runtime errors and ensure smooth operation.

## Creating Color Fills[#](#creating-color-fills)

### Creating a New Color Fill[#](#creating-a-new-color-fill)

Create a new color fill instance using the `createFill()` method with the type `'color'` or the full type name `'//ly.img.ubq/fill/color'`.

```
// Create a color fillconst colorFill = engine.block.createFill('color');
```

The `createFill()` method returns a numeric fill ID. The fill exists independently until you attach it to a block using `setFill()`. If you create a fill but don’t attach it to a block, you must destroy it manually to prevent memory leaks.

### Default Color Fill Properties[#](#default-color-fill-properties)

New color fills have default properties—typically white or transparent. You can discover all available properties using `findAllProperties()`:

```
const properties = engine.block.findAllProperties(colorFillId);console.log(properties); // ["fill/color/value", "type"]
```

## Applying Color Fills[#](#applying-color-fills)

### Setting a Fill on a Block[#](#setting-a-fill-on-a-block)

Once you’ve created a color fill, attach it to a block using `setFill()`:

```
// Apply the fill to the blockengine.block.setFill(block, colorFill);
```

This example creates a graphic block with a rectangle shape and applies the color fill to it. The block will now render with the fill’s color.

### Getting the Current Fill[#](#getting-the-current-fill)

Retrieve the current fill attached to a block using `getFill()` and inspect its type:

```
// Get the current fill from a blockconst currentFill = engine.block.getFill(blueBlock);const fillType = engine.block.getType(currentFill);// eslint-disable-next-line no-consoleconsole.log('Fill type:', fillType); // '//ly.img.ubq/fill/color'
```

## Modifying Color Fill Properties[#](#modifying-color-fill-properties)

### Setting RGB Colors[#](#setting-rgb-colors)

Set the fill color using RGB values with the `setColor()` method. RGB values are normalized floats from 0.0 to 1.0, and the alpha channel controls opacity.

```
const { block: rgbBlock, fill: rgbFill } = createShapeWithFill();engine.block.setColor(rgbFill, 'fill/color/value', {  r: 1.0, // Red (0.0 to 1.0)  g: 0.0, // Green  b: 0.0, // Blue  a: 1.0 // Alpha (opacity)});
```

The alpha channel (a) controls opacity: 1.0 is fully opaque, 0.0 is fully transparent. This allows you to create semi-transparent overlays and layered color effects.

### Setting CMYK Colors[#](#setting-cmyk-colors)

For print workflows, use CMYK color space with the `setColor()` method. CMYK values are also normalized from 0.0 to 1.0, and include a tint value for partial color application.

```
const { block: cmykBlock, fill: cmykFill } = createShapeWithFill('ellipse');engine.block.setColor(cmykFill, 'fill/color/value', {  c: 0.0, // Cyan (0.0 to 1.0)  m: 1.0, // Magenta  y: 0.0, // Yellow  k: 0.0, // Key/Black  tint: 1.0 // Tint value (0.0 to 1.0)});
```

The tint value allows partial application of the color, useful for creating lighter variations without changing the base CMYK values.

### Setting Spot Colors[#](#setting-spot-colors)

Spot colors are named colors that must be defined before use. They’re ideal for maintaining brand consistency and can have both RGB and CMYK approximations for different output scenarios.

```
    // First define the spot color globally    engine.editor.setSpotColorRGB('BrandRed', 0.9, 0.1, 0.1);    engine.editor.setSpotColorRGB('BrandBlue', 0.1, 0.3, 0.9);
    // Then apply to fill    const { block: spotBlock, fill: spotFill } = createShapeWithFill('ellipse');    engine.block.setColor(spotFill, 'fill/color/value', {      name: 'BrandRed',      tint: 1.0,      externalReference: '' // Optional reference system    });
```

First, define the spot color globally using `setSpotColorRGB()` or `setSpotColorCMYK()`, then apply it to your fill using the color name. The tint value controls intensity from 0.0 to 1.0.

### Getting Current Color Value[#](#getting-current-color-value)

Retrieve the current color value from a fill using `getColor()`:

```
// Get the current color valueconst currentColor = engine.block.getColor(blueFill, 'fill/color/value');// eslint-disable-next-line no-consoleconsole.log('Current color:', currentColor);
```

## Enabling and Disabling Color Fills[#](#enabling-and-disabling-color-fills)

### Toggle Fill Visibility[#](#toggle-fill-visibility)

You can temporarily disable a fill without removing it from the block. This preserves all fill properties while making the block transparent:

```
    const { block: toggleBlock, fill: toggleFill } =      createShapeWithFill('star');    engine.block.setColor(toggleFill, 'fill/color/value', {      r: 1.0,      g: 0.5,      b: 0.0,      a: 1.0    });
    // Check fill state    const isEnabled = engine.block.isFillEnabled(toggleBlock);    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log('Fill enabled:', isEnabled); // true
```

Disabling fills is useful for creating stroke-only designs or for temporarily hiding fills during interactive editing sessions. The fill properties remain intact and can be re-enabled at any time.

## Additional Techniques[#](#additional-techniques)

### Sharing Color Fills[#](#sharing-color-fills)

You can share a single fill instance between multiple blocks. Changes to the shared fill affect all blocks using it:

```
    const block1 = engine.block.create('graphic');    const shape1 = engine.block.createShape('rect');    engine.block.setShape(block1, shape1);    engine.block.setWidth(block1, blockWidth);    engine.block.setHeight(block1, blockHeight / 2);    engine.block.appendChild(page, block1);
    const block2 = engine.block.create('graphic');    const shape2 = engine.block.createShape('rect');    engine.block.setShape(block2, shape2);    engine.block.setWidth(block2, blockWidth);    engine.block.setHeight(block2, blockHeight / 2);    engine.block.appendChild(page, block2);
    // Create one fill    const sharedFill = engine.block.createFill('color');    engine.block.setColor(sharedFill, 'fill/color/value', {      r: 0.5,      g: 0.0,      b: 0.5,      a: 1.0    });
    // Apply to both blocks    engine.block.setFill(block1, sharedFill);    engine.block.setFill(block2, sharedFill);
```

With shared fills, modifying the fill’s color updates all blocks simultaneously. The fill is only destroyed when the last block referencing it is destroyed.

### Color Space Conversion[#](#color-space-conversion)

Convert colors between different color spaces using `convertColorToColorSpace()`:

```
    const rgbColor = { r: 1.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 1.0 };
    // Convert to CMYK    const cmykColor = engine.editor.convertColorToColorSpace(rgbColor, 'CMYK');    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log('Converted CMYK color:', cmykColor);
```

This is useful when you need to ensure color consistency across different output mediums (screen vs. print).

## Common Use Cases[#](#common-use-cases)

### Brand Color Application[#](#brand-color-application)

Define and apply brand colors as spot colors to maintain consistency across all design elements:

```
// Apply brand color to multiple elementsconst { block: headerBlock, fill: headerFill } =  createShapeWithFill('star');const brandColor = { name: 'BrandBlue', tint: 1.0, externalReference: '' };engine.block.setColor(headerFill, 'fill/color/value', brandColor);
```

Using spot colors ensures brand consistency and makes it easy to update all instances of a brand color by modifying the spot color definition.

### Transparency Effects[#](#transparency-effects)

Create semi-transparent overlays and visual effects by adjusting the alpha channel:

```
const { block: transparentBlock, fill: transparentFill } =  createShapeWithFill();engine.block.setColor(transparentFill, 'fill/color/value', {  r: 0.0,  g: 0.8,  b: 0.2,  a: 0.5 // 50% opacity});
```

### Print-Ready Colors[#](#print-ready-colors)

Use CMYK color space for designs destined for print production:

```
const { block: printBlock, fill: printFill } =  createShapeWithFill('ellipse');engine.block.setColor(printFill, 'fill/color/value', {  c: 0.0,  m: 0.85,  y: 1.0,  k: 0.0,  tint: 1.0});
```

## Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting)

### Fill Not Visible[#](#fill-not-visible)

If your fill doesn’t appear:

*   Check if fill is enabled: `engine.block.isFillEnabled(block)`
*   Verify alpha channel is not 0: Check the `a` property in RGBA colors
*   Ensure block has valid dimensions (width and height > 0)
*   Confirm block is in the scene hierarchy

### Color Looks Different Than Expected[#](#color-looks-different-than-expected)

If colors don’t match expectations:

*   Verify you’re using the correct color space (RGB vs CMYK)
*   Check if spot color is properly defined before use
*   Review tint values (should be 0.0-1.0)
*   Consider color space conversion for your output medium

### Memory Leaks[#](#memory-leaks)

To prevent memory leaks:

*   Always destroy replaced fills: `engine.block.destroy(oldFill)`
*   Don’t create fills without attaching them to blocks
*   Clean up shared fills when they’re no longer needed

### Cannot Apply Color to Block[#](#cannot-apply-color-to-block)

If you can’t apply a color fill:

*   Verify block supports fills: `engine.block.supportsFill(block)`
*   Check if block has a shape: Some blocks require shapes before fills work
*   Ensure fill object is valid and not already destroyed

```

Some [design blocks](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/) in CE.SDK allow you to modify or replace their fill. The fill is an object that defines the contents within the shape of a block. CreativeEditor SDK supports many different types of fills, such as images, solid colors, gradients and videos.

Similarly to blocks, each fill has a numeric id which can be used to query and [modify its properties](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/).

We currently support the following fill types:

*   `'//ly.img.ubq/fill/color'`
*   `'//ly.img.ubq/fill/gradient/linear'`
*   `'//ly.img.ubq/fill/gradient/radial'`
*   `'//ly.img.ubq/fill/gradient/conical'`
*   `'//ly.img.ubq/fill/image'`
*   `'//ly.img.ubq/fill/video'`
*   `'//ly.img.ubq/fill/pixelStream'`

Note: short types are also accepted, e.g. ‘color’ instead of ‘//ly.img.ubq/fill/color’.

## Accessing Fills[#](#accessing-fills)

Not all types of design blocks support fills, so you should always first call the `supportsFill(id: number): boolean` API before accessing any of the following APIs.

```
engine.block.supportsFill(scene); // Returns falseengine.block.supportsFill(block); // Returns true
```

In order to receive the fill id of a design block, call the `getFill(id: number): number` API. You can now pass this id into other APIs in order to query more information about the fill, e.g. its type via the `getType(id: number): ObjectType` API.

```
const colorFill = engine.block.getFill(block);const defaultRectFillType = engine.block.getType(colorFill);
```

## Fill Properties[#](#fill-properties)

Just like design blocks, fills with different types have different properties that you can query and modify via the API. Use `findAllProperties(id: number): string[]` in order to get a list of all properties of a given fill.

For the solid color fill in this example, the call would return `["fill/color/value", "type"]`.

Please refer to the [design blocks](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/) for a complete list of all available properties for each type of fill.

```
const allFillProperties = engine.block.findAllProperties(colorFill);
```

Once we know the property keys of a fill, we can use the same APIs as for design blocks in order to modify those properties. For example, we can use `setColor(id: number, property: string, value: Color): void` in order to change the color of the fill to red.

Once we do this, our graphic block with rect shape will be filled with solid red.

```
engine.block.setColor(colorFill, 'fill/color/value', {  r: 1.0,  g: 0.0,  b: 0.0,  a: 1.0});
```

## Disabling Fills[#](#disabling-fills)

You can disable and enable a fill using the `setFillEnabled(id: number, enabled: boolean): void` API, for example in cases where the design block should only have a stroke but no fill. Notice that you have to pass the id of the design block and not of the fill to the API.

```
engine.block.setFillEnabled(block, false);engine.block.setFillEnabled(block, !engine.block.isFillEnabled(block));
```

## Changing Fill Types[#](#changing-fill-types)

All design blocks that support fills allow you to also exchange their current fill for any other type of fill. In order to do this, you need to first create a new fill object using `createFill(type: FillType): number`.

```
const imageFill = engine.block.createFill('image');engine.block.setString(  imageFill,  'fill/image/imageFileURI',  'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1.jpg');
```

In order to assign a fill to a design block, simply call `setFill(id: number, fill: number): void`. Make sure to delete the previous fill of the design block first if you don’t need it any more, otherwise we will have leaked it into the scene and won’t be able to access it any more, because we don’t know its id.

Notice that we don’t use the `appendChild` API here, which only works with design blocks and not fills.

When a fill is attached to one design block, it will be automatically destroyed when the block itself gets destroyed.

```
  engine.block.destroy(engine.block.getFill(block));  engine.block.setFill(block, imageFill);
  /* The following line would also destroy imageFill */  // engine.block.destroy(circle);

## Duplicating Fills[#](#duplicating-fills)

If we duplicate a design block with a fill that is only attached to this block, the fill will automatically be duplicated as well. In order to modify the properties of the duplicate fill, we have to query its id from the duplicate block.

```
  const duplicateBlock = engine.block.duplicate(block);  engine.block.setPositionX(duplicateBlock, 450);  const autoDuplicateFill = engine.block.getFill(duplicateBlock);  engine.block.setString(    autoDuplicateFill,    'fill/image/imageFileURI',    'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_2.jpg'  );
  // const manualDuplicateFill = engine.block.duplicate(autoDuplicateFill);  // /* We could now assign this fill to another block. */  // engine.block.destroy(manualDuplicateFill);
```

## Sharing Fills[#](#sharing-fills)

It is also possible to share a single fill instance between multiple design blocks. In that case, changing the properties of the fill will apply to all of the blocks that it’s attached to at once.

Destroying a block with a shared fill will not destroy the fill until there are no other design blocks left that still use that fill.

```
  const sharedFillBlock = engine.block.create('graphic');  engine.block.setShape(sharedFillBlock, engine.block.createShape('rect'));  engine.block.setPositionX(sharedFillBlock, 350);  engine.block.setPositionY(sharedFillBlock, 400);  engine.block.setWidth(sharedFillBlock, 100);  engine.block.setHeight(sharedFillBlock, 100);  engine.block.appendChild(page, sharedFillBlock);
  engine.block.setFill(sharedFillBlock, engine.block.getFill(block));
```

## Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here is the full code for working with fills:

```
// Check if block supports strokesif (engine.block.supportsStroke(block)) {  // Enable the stroke  engine.block.setStrokeEnabled(block, true);  const strokeIsEnabled = engine.block.isStrokeEnabled(block);
  // Configure it  engine.block.setStrokeWidth(block, 5);  const strokeWidth = engine.block.getStrokeWidth(block);  engine.block.setStrokeColor(block, { r: 0, g: 1, b: 0, a: 1 });  const strokeColor = engine.block.getStrokeColor(block);  engine.block.setStrokeStyle(block, 'Dashed');  const strokeStyle = engine.block.getStrokeStyle(block);  engine.block.setStrokePosition(block, 'Outer');  const strokePosition = engine.block.getStrokePosition(block);  engine.block.setStrokeCornerGeometry(block, 'Round');  const strokeCornerGeometry = engine.block.getStrokeCornerGeometry(block);}
```

CE.SDK allows you to store custom metadata in your scenes. You can attach metadata to your scene or directly to your individual design blocks within the scene. This metadata is persistent across saving and loading of scenes. It simply consists of key value pairs of strings. Using any string-based serialization format such as JSON will allow you to store even complex objects. Please note that when duplicating blocks their metadata will also be duplicated.

## Working with Metadata[#](#working-with-metadata)

We can add metadata to any design block using `setMetadata(block: number, key: string, value: string)`. This also includes the scene block.

```
  engine.block.setMetadata(scene, 'author', 'img.ly');  engine.block.setMetadata(block, 'customer_id', '1234567890');
  /* We can even store complex objects */  const payment = {    id: 5,    method: 'credit_card',    received: true  };  engine.block.setMetadata(block, 'payment', JSON.stringify(payment));
```

We can retrieve metadata from any design block or scene using `getMetadata(block: number, key: string): string`. Before accessing the metadata you check for its existence using `hasMetadata(block: number, key: string): boolean`.

```
  /* This will return 'img.ly' */  engine.block.getMetadata(scene, 'author');
  /* This will return '1000000' */  engine.block.getMetadata(block, 'customer_id');
```

We can query all metadata keys from any design block or scene using `findAllMetadata(block: number): string[]`. For blocks without any metadata, this will return an empty list.

```
/* This will return ['customer_id'] */engine.block.findAllMetadata(block);
```

If you want to get rid of any metadata, you can use `removeMetadata(block: number, key: string)`.

```
  engine.block.removeMetadata(block, 'payment');
  /* This will return false */  engine.block.hasMetadata(block, 'payment');
```

Metadata will automatically be saved and loaded as part the scene. So you don’t have to worry about it getting lost or having to save it separately.

```
  /* We save our scene and reload it from scratch */  const sceneString = await engine.scene.saveToString();  scene = await engine.scene.loadFromString(sceneString);
  /* This still returns 'img.ly' */  engine.block.getMetadata(scene, 'author');
  /* And this still returns '1234567890' */  engine.block.getMetadata(block, 'customer_id');
```

Understanding the difference between **fill-level trimming** and **block-level timing** is essential. Fill-level trimming (`setTrimOffset`, `setTrimLength`) controls which portion of the source media plays, while block-level timing (`setTimeOffset`, `setDuration`) controls when and how long the block appears in your timeline. These two systems work together to give you complete control over video playback.

export default Example;
```

This guide covers how to use the built-in timeline UI for visual trimming and how to trim videos programmatically using the Engine API.

## Understanding Trim Concepts[#](#understanding-trim-concepts)

### Fill-Level Trimming[#](#fill-level-trimming)

When we trim a video, we’re adjusting properties of the video’s fill, not the block itself. The fill represents the media source—the actual video file. Fill-level trimming determines which portion of that source media will play.

`setTrimOffset` specifies where playback starts within the source media. A trim offset of `2.0` skips the first two seconds of the video file.

`setTrimLength` defines how much of the source media plays from the trim offset point. A trim length of 5.0 will play 5 seconds of the source. Combined with a trim offset of 2.0, the video plays from 2 seconds to 7 seconds of the original file.

This trimming is completely non-destructive—the source video file remains unchanged. You can adjust trim values at any time to show different portions of the same media.

Audio blocks use the same trim API (`setTrimOffset`, `setTrimLength`) as video blocks. The concepts are identical, though this guide focuses on video. For audio-specific workflows and examples, see the dedicated [Trim Audio guide](../trim-audio/).

### Block-Level Timing[#](#block-level-timing)

Block-level timing is separate from trimming and controls when and how long a block exists in the timeline. `setTimeOffset` determines when the block becomes active in the composition timeline (useful for track-based layouts). `setDuration` controls how long the block appears in the timeline.

The _trim_ controls what plays from the source media, while the _duration_ controls how long that playback appears in your timeline. If the duration exceeds the trim length and if looping is disabled, the trimmed portion will play once and then hold the last frame for the remaining duration.

### Common Use Cases[#](#common-use-cases)

Trimming enables many video editing workflows:

*   **Remove unwanted segments** - Cut intro or outro portions to keep videos concise
*   **Extract key moments** - Isolate specific segments from longer source media
*   **Sync audio to video** - Trim audio and video independently for perfect alignment
*   **Create loops** - Trim to a specific length and enable loop mode for seamless repeating content
*   **Uniform compositions** - Batch trim multiple clips to consistent lengths

## Trimming Video via UI[#](#trimming-video-via-ui)

### Accessing Trim Controls[#](#accessing-trim-controls)

When you select a video block in the timeline, CE.SDK reveals trim handles at the edges of the clip. These visual controls appear as draggable handles on the left and right sides of the video block in the timeline panel.

The trimmed portion of your video is visually distinguished from the untrimmed regions on either side that represent portions of the source media that won’t play due to trim settings. This visual feedback makes it immediately clear which part of your video will be included in the final composition.

### Using Trim Handles[#](#using-trim-handles)

We adjust trimming by dragging the handles. The left handle controls the trim offset—dragging it right increases the offset, skipping more of the beginning. Dragging left decreases the offset, including more from the start of the video.

The right handle adjusts the trim length by changing where the video stops playing. Dragging left shortens the trim length, ending playback earlier. Dragging right extends it, playing more of the source media.

For frame-accurate control, many CE.SDK interfaces provide numeric input fields where you can type exact time values in seconds. This precision is essential when you need to trim to specific frames or match exact durations.

The icon on the trim handle turns into an outward-pointing arrow.

### Preview During Trimming[#](#preview-during-trimming)

Scrubbing the playhead through your trimmed content shows exactly what will play. This immediate feedback loop makes it easy to find the perfect trim points visually.

If your video extends beyond the page duration, out-of-bounds content is indicated with a blue overlay in the timeline and won’t be visible in the final output.

### Constraints and Limitations[#](#constraints-and-limitations)

CE.SDK enforces a minimum trim duration to prevent creating zero-length or extremely short clips that could cause playback issues. If you try to drag handles closer than this minimum, the handle will resist further movement.

When clips extend beyond page duration boundaries, grey visual indicators show which portions fall outside. While the video block may be longer than the page, only content within the page duration will appear in exports or final compositions.

## Programmatic Video Trimming[#](#programmatic-video-trimming)

### Prerequisites and Setup[#](#prerequisites-and-setup)

For applications that need to apply trimming programmatically—whether for automation, batch processing, or dynamic user experiences—we start by setting up CE.SDK in Video mode with the proper configuration.

```
// Enable video editing features in CE.SDKcesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.video');cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.timeline');cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.playback');
```

Video mode is required for trimming operations. Design mode doesn’t provide timeline-based editing capabilities, so we must use `createVideoScene()` to access trim functionality.

### Loading Video Resources[#](#loading-video-resources)

Before accessing trim properties or setting trim values, we must load the video resource metadata using `forceLoadAVResource`. This critical step ensures CE.SDK has downloaded information about the video’s duration, frame rate, and other properties needed for accurate trimming.

```
    // Pattern: Always load video resource before accessing trim properties    // This ensures metadata (duration, frame rate, etc.) is available    await engine.block.forceLoadAVResource(videoFill);
    // Now we can safely access video metadata    const totalDuration = engine.block.getDouble(      videoFill,      'fill/video/totalDuration'    );    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log('Total video duration:', totalDuration, 'seconds');
```

Skipping this step is a common source of errors. Without loading the resource first, trim operations may fail silently or produce unexpected results. Always await `forceLoadAVResource` before calling any trim methods.

Once loaded, we can access metadata like `totalDuration` and `frameRate` from the video fill. This information helps us calculate valid trim ranges and ensures we don’t try to trim beyond the available media.

### Checking Trim Support[#](#checking-trim-support)

Before applying trim operations, we verify that a block supports trimming. While video blocks typically support trimming, other block types like pages and scenes do not.

```
    // Create a sample video block to demonstrate trim support checking    const sampleVideo = await engine.block.addVideo(      videoUri,      blockWidth,      blockHeight    );
    // Get the video fill - trim operations are applied to the fill, not the block    const videoFill = engine.block.getFill(sampleVideo);
    // Check if the fill supports trim operations    const supportsTrim = engine.block.supportsTrim(videoFill);    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log('Video fill supports trim:', supportsTrim); // true for video fills
    // Select this block so timeline controls are visible    engine.block.setSelected(sampleVideo, true);
```

Checking support prevents runtime errors and allows you to build robust interfaces that only show trim controls for compatible blocks. Graphic blocks with video fills also support trimming, not just top-level video blocks.

### Trimming Video[#](#trimming-video)

Once we’ve confirmed trim support and loaded the resource, we can apply trimming. Here we create a video block and trim it to start 2 seconds into the source media and play for 5 seconds.

```
    // Pattern #1: Demonstrate Individual Before Combined    // Create a separate video block for basic trim demonstration    const basicTrimVideo = await engine.block.addVideo(      videoUri,      blockWidth,      blockHeight    );
    // Get the fill to apply trim operations    const basicTrimFill = engine.block.getFill(basicTrimVideo);
    // Load resource before trimming    await engine.block.forceLoadAVResource(basicTrimFill);
    // Trim video to start at 2 seconds and play for 5 seconds    engine.block.setTrimOffset(basicTrimFill, 2.0);    engine.block.setTrimLength(basicTrimFill, 5.0);
```

The trim offset of 2.0 skips the first 2 seconds of the video. The trim length of 5.0 means exactly 5 seconds of video will play, starting from that offset point. So this video plays from the 2-second mark to the 7-second mark of the original file.

### Getting Current Trim Values[#](#getting-current-trim-values)

We can retrieve the current trim settings to verify values, build UI controls, or make relative adjustments based on existing settings.

```
// Get current trim values to verify or modifyconst currentOffset = engine.block.getTrimOffset(basicTrimFill);const currentLength = engine.block.getTrimLength(basicTrimFill);// eslint-disable-next-line no-consoleconsole.log(  `Basic trim - Offset: ${currentOffset}s, Length: ${currentLength}s`);
```

These getter methods return the current trim offset and length in seconds. Use them to populate UI inputs, calculate remaining media duration, or create undo/redo functionality in your application.

## Additional Trimming Techniques[#](#additional-trimming-techniques)

### Trimming with Block Duration[#](#trimming-with-block-duration)

Take a look at this example to understand how trim length and block duration interact:

```
    // Pattern #5: Progressive Complexity - coordinating trim with block duration    // Create a video block demonstrating trim + duration coordination    const durationTrimVideo = await engine.block.addVideo(      videoUri,      blockWidth,      blockHeight    );
    const durationTrimFill = engine.block.getFill(durationTrimVideo);    await engine.block.forceLoadAVResource(durationTrimFill);
    // Set trim: play portion from 3s to 8s (5 seconds of content)    engine.block.setTrimOffset(durationTrimFill, 3.0);    engine.block.setTrimLength(durationTrimFill, 5.0);
    // Set block duration: how long this block appears in the timeline    // When duration equals trim length, the entire trimmed portion plays once    engine.block.setDuration(durationTrimVideo, 5.0);
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log(      'Trim+Duration - Block will play trimmed 5s exactly once in timeline'    );
```

In this example, we trim the video to a 5-second segment (from 3s to 8s of the source) and set the block duration to exactly 5 seconds. This means the entire trimmed portion plays once, then stops. The block duration matches the trim length, so there’s no looping or holding on the last frame.

If the block duration is less than the trim length, only part of the trimmed segment will play. If duration exceeds trim length without looping enabled, the video plays the trimmed portion once and holds on the last frame for the remaining time.

### Trimming with Looping[#](#trimming-with-looping)

Looping allows a trimmed video segment to repeat seamlessly. We enable looping and set a block duration longer than the trim length to create repeating playback.

```
    // Create a video block with trim + looping    const loopingTrimVideo = await engine.block.addVideo(      videoUri,      blockWidth,      blockHeight    );
    const loopingTrimFill = engine.block.getFill(loopingTrimVideo);    await engine.block.forceLoadAVResource(loopingTrimFill);
    // Trim to a short 3-second segment    engine.block.setTrimOffset(loopingTrimFill, 1.0);    engine.block.setTrimLength(loopingTrimFill, 3.0);
    // Enable looping so the 3-second segment repeats    engine.block.setLooping(loopingTrimFill, true);
    // Set duration longer than trim length - the trim will loop to fill it    engine.block.setDuration(loopingTrimVideo, 9.0);
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log(      'Looping trim - 3s segment will loop 3 times to fill 9s duration'    );
```

Here we trim to a 3-second segment and enable looping. The block duration of 9 seconds means this 3-second segment will loop 3 times to fill the entire duration. This technique is perfect for creating background loops, repeated motion graphics, or extending short clips.

When looping is enabled, CE.SDK automatically restarts playback from the trim offset when it reaches the end of the trim length.

### Frame-Accurate Trimming[#](#frame-accurate-trimming)

For precise editing, we often need to trim to specific frame boundaries rather than arbitrary time values. Using the video’s frame rate metadata, we can calculate exact frame-based trim points.

```
    // Pattern #6: Descriptive naming - frame-accurate trim demonstration    // Create a video block for frame-accurate trimming    const frameAccurateTrimVideo = await engine.block.addVideo(      videoUri,      blockWidth,      blockHeight    );
    const frameFill = engine.block.getFill(frameAccurateTrimVideo);    await engine.block.forceLoadAVResource(frameFill);
    // Note: Frame rate is not directly accessible via the API    // For this example, we'll assume a common frame rate of 30fps    const frameRate = 30;
    // Calculate trim offset based on specific frame number    // Example: Start at frame 60 for a 30fps video = 2.0 seconds    const startFrame = 60;    const trimOffsetSeconds = startFrame / frameRate;
    // Trim for exactly 150 frames = 5.0 seconds at 30fps    const trimFrames = 150;    const trimLengthSeconds = trimFrames / frameRate;
    engine.block.setTrimOffset(frameFill, trimOffsetSeconds);    engine.block.setTrimLength(frameFill, trimLengthSeconds);
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log(      `Frame-accurate trim - Frame rate: ${frameRate}fps (assumed), Start frame: ${startFrame}, Duration: ${trimFrames} frames`    );
```

We first retrieve the frame rate from the video fill metadata. Then we convert frame numbers to time offsets by dividing by the frame rate. Starting at frame 60 with a 30fps video gives us exactly 2.0 seconds. Trimming for 150 frames provides exactly 5.0 seconds of playback.

This technique ensures frame-accurate edits, which is essential for professional video editing workflows. Remember that codec compression may affect true frame accuracy—for critical applications, test with your target codecs to verify precision.

### Batch Processing Multiple Videos[#](#batch-processing-multiple-videos)

When working with multiple video clips that need consistent trimming, we can iterate through collections and apply the same trim settings programmatically.

```
    // Pattern: Batch processing multiple video clips    // Create multiple video blocks to demonstrate batch trimming    const batchVideoUris = [      'https://img.ly/static/ubq_video_samples/bbb.mp4',      'https://img.ly/static/ubq_video_samples/bbb.mp4',      'https://img.ly/static/ubq_video_samples/bbb.mp4'    ];
    const batchVideos = [];    for (let i = 0; i < batchVideoUris.length; i++) {      const batchVideo = await engine.block.addVideo(        batchVideoUris[i],        blockWidth,        blockHeight      );      batchVideos.push(batchVideo);
      // Get the fill for trim operations      const batchFill = engine.block.getFill(batchVideo);
      // Load resource before trimming      await engine.block.forceLoadAVResource(batchFill);
      // Apply consistent trim: first 4 seconds of each video      engine.block.setTrimOffset(batchFill, 0.0);      engine.block.setTrimLength(batchFill, 4.0);
      // Set consistent duration      engine.block.setDuration(batchVideo, 4.0);    }
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log('Batch trim - Applied consistent 4s trim to 3 video blocks');
```

We create multiple video blocks and apply identical trim settings to each one. This ensures consistency across clips—perfect for creating video montages, multi-angle compositions, or any scenario where uniform clip lengths are required.

When batch processing, always load each video’s resources before trimming. Don’t assume all videos have the same duration—check total duration to ensure your trim values don’t exceed available media.

## Trim vs Duration Interaction[#](#trim-vs-duration-interaction)

### How setDuration Affects Playback[#](#how-setduration-affects-playback)

The relationship between trim length and block duration determines playback behavior. When block duration equals trim length, the video plays the trimmed portion exactly once. When duration is less than trim length, playback stops before the trimmed portion finishes. When duration exceeds trim length with looping disabled, the video plays once and holds on the last frame.

With looping enabled, exceeding trim length causes the trimmed segment to repeat until the block duration is filled. This creates seamless loops as long as the content loops visually.

### Best Practices[#](#best-practices)

For predictable behavior, always consider both trim and duration together. Set trim values first to define the source media segment you want. Then set duration to control timeline length. If you want the entire trimmed segment to play once, match duration to trim length. For looping content, enable looping before setting a longer duration.

When building UIs, update both values together when users adjust trim handles. This prevents confusion about why a video isn’t playing the full trimmed length (duration too short) or why it’s holding on the last frame (duration too long without looping).

## Performance Considerations[#](#performance-considerations)

CE.SDK’s video system is optimized for real-time editing, but understanding these performance factors helps you build responsive applications:

*   **Resource loading**: Use `forceLoadAVResource` judiciously. Loading resources has overhead, so batch loads when possible rather than loading repeatedly.
*   **Trim adjustments**: Changing trim values is lightweight—CE.SDK updates the playback range without reprocessing the video. You can adjust trim interactively without performance concerns.
*   **Mobile devices**: Video decoding is more expensive on mobile. Limit the number of simultaneous video blocks and consider lower resolution sources for editing (high resolution for export).
*   **Long videos**: Very long source videos (30+ minutes) may have slower seeking to trim offsets. Consider pre-cutting extremely long videos into shorter segments.

Test your trim operations on target devices early in development to ensure acceptable performance for your users.

## Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting)

### Trim Not Applied[#](#trim-not-applied)

If setting trim values has no visible effect, the most common cause is forgetting to await `forceLoadAVResource`. The resource must be loaded before trim values take effect. Always load resources first.

Another possibility is confusing time offset with trim offset. `setTimeOffset` controls when the block appears in the timeline, while `setTrimOffset` controls where in the source media playback starts. Make sure you’re using the correct method.

### Incorrect Trim Calculation[#](#incorrect-trim-calculation)

If trim values seem offset or produce unexpected results, verify you’re calculating based on the source media duration, not the block duration. Use `getTotalDuration` from the fill metadata to understand the available media length.

Also check that you’re not exceeding the total available duration. Trim offset plus trim length should never exceed total duration. CE.SDK may clamp values automatically, but it’s better to validate before setting.

### Playback Beyond Trim Length[#](#playback-beyond-trim-length)

If video plays past the intended trim length, check that block duration doesn’t exceed trim length. When duration is longer and looping is disabled, the video will hold on the last frame for the excess duration.

Ensure looping is set correctly for your use case. If you want playback to stop at the trim length, set duration equal to trim length or enable looping.

### Audio/Video Desync[#](#audiovideo-desync)

When trimming both audio and video independently, desynchronization can occur if offset and duration values aren’t coordinated carefully. Calculate both trim offsets to maintain the original relationship between audio and video timing.

Consider the original sync point between audio and video in the source media. If they were perfectly synced at 0 seconds originally, maintaining the same offset difference preserves that sync.

### Frame-Accurate Trim Issues[#](#frame-accurate-trim-issues)

If frame-accurate trimming doesn’t land on exact frames, remember that floating-point precision can cause tiny discrepancies. Round your calculated values to a reasonable precision (e.g., 3 decimal places).

Also understand codec limitations. Variable frame rate videos don’t have perfectly uniform frame timing, so true frame accuracy may not be possible. Use constant frame rate sources for critical frame-accurate applications.

## API Reference[#](#api-reference)

### TypeScript Type Definitions[#](#typescript-type-definitions)

*   `DesignBlockId`: Unique identifier for design blocks
*   Time values measured in seconds (floating-point)
*   All trim/duration values are in timeline seconds (affected by playback rate)

## Best Practices[#](#best-practices-1)

### Workflow Recommendations[#](#workflow-recommendations)

1.  Always `await forceLoadAVResource()` before accessing trim properties
2.  Check `supportsTrim()` before applying trim operations
3.  Coordinate trim length with block duration for predictable behavior
4.  Use TypeScript for type safety with CE.SDK API
5.  Preview trimmed content before final export
6.  Validate trim values don’t exceed total media duration

### Code Organization[#](#code-organization)

*   Separate media loading from trim logic
*   Create helper functions for common trim patterns (e.g., `trimToFrames`, `trimToPercentage`)
*   Handle errors gracefully with try-catch blocks around `forceLoadAVResource`
*   Document complex trim calculations with comments explaining frame math

### Performance Optimization[#](#performance-optimization)

*   Avoid redundant `forceLoadAVResource` calls—load once, trim multiple times
*   Use appropriate preview quality settings during editing to maintain responsiveness
*   Test on target devices early to identify performance bottlenecks

# Add Captions

```
const scene = await engine.scene.createVideo();const page = engine.block.create('page');await engine.block.appendChild(scene, page);engine.block.setWidth(page, 1280);engine.block.setHeight(page, 720);engine.editor.setSettingBoolean('features/videoCaptionsEnabled', true);
engine.block.setDuration(page, 20);
const caption1 = engine.block.create('caption');engine.block.setString(caption1, 'caption/text', 'Caption text 1');const caption2 = engine.block.create('caption');engine.block.setString(caption2, 'caption/text', 'Caption text 2');
const captionBlocks = await engine.block.createCaptionsFromURI(  'https://example.com/captions.srt',);
const captionTrack = engine.block.create('captionTrack');await engine.block.appendChild(page, captionTrack);await engine.block.appendChild(captionTrack, caption1);await engine.block.appendChild(captionTrack, caption2);
engine.block.setDuration(caption1, 3);engine.block.setDuration(caption2, 5);
engine.block.setTimeOffset(caption1, 0);engine.block.setTimeOffset(caption2, 3);
const fill = engine.block.getFill(caption1);engine.block.setColor(fill, 'fill/color', { r: 1, g: 0, b: 0, a: 1 });
await engine.block.exportVideo(  page,  'video/mp4',  progress => {    console.log('Export progress:', progress);  },  { duration: 20 },);
```

For video scenes, open captions can be added in CE.SDK. These allow to follow the content without the audio.

Two blocks are available for this. The `Caption` blocks hold the text of individual captions and the `CaptionTrack` is an optional structuring block to hold the `Caption` blocks, e.g., all captions for one video.

The `"playback/timeOffset"` property of each caption block controls when the caption should be shown and the `"playback/duration"` property how long the caption should be shown. Usually, the captions do not overlap. As the playback time of the page progresses, the corresponding caption is shown.

With the `"caption/text"` property, the text of the caption can be set. In addition, all text properties are also available for captions, e.g., to change the font, the font size, or the alignment.

Position, size, and style changes on caption blocks are automatically synced across all caption blocks.

Finally, the whole page can be exported as a video file using the `block.exportVideo` function.

## A Note on Browser Support[#](#a-note-on-browser-support)

Video mode heavily relies on modern features like web codecs. A detailed list of supported browser versions can be found in our [Supported Browsers](nextjs/browser-support-28c1b0/). Please also take note of [possible restrictions based on the host platform](nextjs/compatibility-139ef9/) browsers are running on.

## Creating a Video Scene[#](#creating-a-video-scene)

First, we create a scene that is set up for captions editing by calling the `scene.createVideo()` API. Then we create a page, add it to the scene and define its dimensions. This page will hold our composition.

```
const scene = await engine.scene.createVideo();const page = engine.block.create('page');await engine.block.appendChild(scene, page);engine.block.setWidth(page, 1280);engine.block.setHeight(page, 720);engine.editor.setSettingBoolean('features/videoCaptionsEnabled', true);
```

## Setting Page Duration[#](#setting-page-duration)

Next, we define the duration of the page using the `setDuration(block: number, duration: number): void` API to be 20 seconds long. This will be the total duration of our exported captions in the end.

```
engine.block.setDuration(page, 20);
```

## Adding Captions[#](#adding-captions)

In this example, we want to show two captions, one after the other. For this, we create two caption blocks.

```
const caption1 = engine.block.create('caption');engine.block.setString(caption1, 'caption/text', 'Caption text 1');const caption2 = engine.block.create('caption');engine.block.setString(caption2, 'caption/text', 'Caption text 2');
```

As an alternative to manually creating the captions, changing the text, and adjusting the timings, the captions can also be loaded from a caption file, i.e., an SRT or VTT file with the `createCaptionsFromURI` API. This return a list of caption blocks, with the parsed texts and timings. These can be added to a caption track as well.

```
const captionBlocks = await engine.block.createCaptionsFromURI(  'https://example.com/captions.srt',);
```

## Creating a Captions Track[#](#creating-a-captions-track)

While we could add the two blocks directly to the page, we can alternatively also use the `captionTrack` block to group them.

Caption tracks themselves cannot be selected directly by clicking on the canvas, nor do they have any visual representation.

We create a `captionTrack` block, add it to the page and add both captions in the order in which they should play as the track’s children.

The dimensions of a `captionTrack` are always derived from the dimensions of its children, so you should not call the `setWidth` or `setHeight` APIs on a track, but on its children instead.

```
const captionTrack = engine.block.create('captionTrack');await engine.block.appendChild(page, captionTrack);await engine.block.appendChild(captionTrack, caption1);await engine.block.appendChild(captionTrack, caption2);
```

## Modifying Captions[#](#modifying-captions)

By default, each caption block has a duration of 3 seconds after it is created. If we want to show it on the page for a different amount of time, we can use the `setDuration` API.

```
engine.block.setDuration(caption1, 3);engine.block.setDuration(caption2, 5);
```

The position and size of the captions is automatically synced across all captions that are attached to the scene. Therefore, changes only need to be made on one of the caption blocks.

```
engine.block.setTimeOffset(caption1, 0);engine.block.setTimeOffset(caption2, 3);
```

The styling of the captions is also automatically synced across all captions that are attached to the scene. For example, changing the text color to red on the first block, changes it on all caption blocks.

```
const fill = engine.block.getFill(caption1);engine.block.setColor(fill, 'fill/color', { r: 1, g: 0, b: 0, a: 1 });
```

## Exporting Video[#](#exporting-video)

You can start exporting the entire page as a captions file by calling `exportVideo()`. The encoding process will run in the background. You can get notified about the progress of the encoding process by the `progressCallback`. It will be called whenever another frame has been encoded.

Since the encoding process runs in the background the engine will stay interactive. So, you can continue to use the engine to manipulate the scene. Please note that these changes won’t be visible in the exported captions file because the scene’s state has been frozen at the start of the export.

```
await engine.block.exportVideo(  page,  'video/mp4',  progress => {    console.log('Export progress:', progress);  },  { duration: 20 },);
```

# Vectorize

This plugin introduces vectorization for the CE.SDK editor, leveraging the power of the [vectorizer library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@imgly/vectorizer). It integrates seamlessly with CE.SDK, providing users with an efficient tool to vectorize images directly in the browser with ease and no additional costs or privacy concerns.

## Installation[#](#installation)

You can install the plugin via npm or yarn. Use the following commands to install the package:

```
yarn add @imgly/plugin-vectorizer-webnpm install @imgly/plugin-vectorizer-web
```

## Usage[#](#usage)

Adding the plugin to CE.SDK will automatically register a vectorizer canvas menu component that can be rendered for every block with an image fill. To automatically add this button to the canvas menu, please use the `locations` configuration option.

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from '@cesdk/cesdk-js';import VectorizerPlugin from '@imgly/plugin-vectorizer-web';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',};
const cesdk = await CreativeEditorSDK.create(container, config);await cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources(),  await cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({ sceneMode: 'Design', withUploadAssetSources: true });,  await cesdk.unstable_addPlugin(    VectorizerPlugin({      // This will automatically prepend a button to the canvas menu      ui: { locations: 'canvasMenu' },    }),  );
await cesdk.createDesignScene();
```

## Configuration[#](#configuration)

### Adding Canvas Menu Component[#](#adding-canvas-menu-component)

After adding the plugin to CE.SDK, it will register a component that can be used inside the canvas menu. It is not added by default but can be included using the following configuration:

```
// Either pass a location via the configuration object, ...VectorizerPlugin({  ui: { locations: 'canvasMenu' },});
```

### Further Configuration Options[#](#further-configuration-options)

#### Timeout[#](#timeout)

The duration of the vectorization process depends on the complexity of the input image. For highly detailed images, it can take a considerable amount of time. A timeout is configured to abort the process after 30 seconds by default, but this can be customized using the `timeout` option.

```
VectorizerPlugin({  // Reduce the timeout to 5s  timeout: 5000,});
```

#### Threshold for Group Creation[#](#threshold-for-group-creation)

For simple vectorized images, using groups makes a lot of sense. Single paths can be selected, allowing the user to change the color, for instance. However, once the number of paths exceeds a certain threshold, the user experience deteriorates significantly as it becomes difficult to select individual paths.

Based on the use case you can adapt this threshold (default is 500).

```
VectorizerPlugin({  // Reducing the maximal number of groups to 200  groupingThreshold: 200,});
```

# Transform

Image transformations in CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) allow you to adjust the size, orientation, and framing of images to better fit your designs. Whether you need to crop out unnecessary areas, rotate an image for better composition, or resize assets for different outputs, transformations provide powerful tools for fine-tuning visuals.

You can perform transformations both through the built-in user interface and programmatically using the SDK’s APIs, giving you flexibility depending on your workflow.

[Launch Web Demo](https://img.ly/showcases/cesdk)[

Get Started

](nextjs/get-started/overview-e18f40/)

## Available Transformations[#](#available-transformations)

CE.SDK supports several types of image transformations:

*   **Crop**: Trim an image to focus on a specific area or fit a desired aspect ratio.
*   **Move**: Position an image on the canvas using either absolute units or percentages.
*   **Rotate**: Rotate the image by a custom degree to adjust orientation.
*   **Resize**: Change the width and height independently to fit layout requirements.
*   **Scale**: Uniformly enlarge or reduce the size of the image while maintaining its aspect ratio.
*   **Flip**: Mirror the image horizontally or vertically to create a reversed version.

Each transformation can be used individually or combined for more complex edits.

## Applying Transformations[#](#applying-transformations)

### UI-Based Transformation[#](#ui-based-transformation)

You can apply transformations directly in the CE.SDK user interface. The editor provides intuitive controls for cropping, rotating, resizing, scaling, and flipping images. This makes it easy for users to visually adjust images without writing any code.

### Programmatic Transformation[#](#programmatic-transformation)

Developers can also apply transformations programmatically by interacting with the SDK’s API. This allows for dynamic image adjustments based on application logic, user input, or automated processes.

## Combining Transformations[#](#combining-transformations)

CE.SDK lets you chain multiple transformations together in a single operation. For example, you might scale an image before cropping it to ensure the best possible resolution.

When combining transformations, consider applying scaling first to avoid quality loss during cropping or rotation. Structuring transformations thoughtfully helps maintain visual clarity and optimize output quality.

# Adding Custom Caption Presets to CE.SDK

Video captions have become an essential part of digital content, improving accessibility and engagement. With CE.SDK’s caption presets feature, you can offer your users a selection of predefined caption styles that they can apply with a single click.

This guide will show you how to add your own custom caption presets by updating the content.json file that CE.SDK uses to discover available presets. This approach allows you to extend the existing caption presets functionality without implementing a custom asset source from scratch.

## Understanding the Caption Presets Structure[#](#understanding-the-caption-presets-structure)

CE.SDK’s caption presets are organized in a specific folder structure:

```
assets/v4/ly.img.captionPresets/├── content.json                # Master index of all presets├── presets/                    # Folder containing preset files│   ├── my-custom-preset.blocks  # Serialized caption block with styling│   └── …└── thumbnails/                 # Folder containing preview images    ├── my-custom-preset.png    # Preview image for preset    └── …
```

The main `content.json` file acts as an index that lists all available presets with their metadata. Instead of individual folders for each preset, all preset files are organized in two main folders:

1.  `presets/`: Contains all the serialized caption block files (`.blocks` files)
2.  `thumbnails/`: Contains all the preview images for the presets (`.png` files)

When CE.SDK loads the caption presets, it reads the `content.json` file to discover all available presets and their locations. This follows the same pattern as other [asset sources in CE.SDK](nextjs/import-media/from-remote-source-b65faf/), but with this specific folder organization.

## Creating Custom Caption Presets[#](#creating-custom-caption-presets)

Before updating the content.json file, you’ll need to create your custom preset styles. The easiest way to create a custom preset is to design it within CE.SDK itself:

1.  Create a text element in your project. Style and animate it as desired (using a text element as the basis is best since it supports all the styling properties needed for captions)
2.  Use the engine’s serialization API to export the text block:

```
// Assuming 'textBlock' is the ID of your styled text elementconst serializedBlock = await engine.block.saveToString([textBlock]);
```

3.  Save this serialized data as a `.blocks` file (e.g., `my-custom-preset.blocks`)
4.  Create a thumbnail image that visually represents your preset style

> **Important**: Using a text element as the basis for your caption preset is highly recommended. Text elements support all the necessary styling properties (colors, fonts, backgrounds, shadows, etc.) and ensure compatibility with the caption system. For more details on text properties, see the [text styling documentation](nextjs/text-8a993a/).

### Adding Customizable Properties[#](#adding-customizable-properties)

One of the key advantages of the caption presets system is that it allows users to customize specific properties of a preset. To enable this, you need to define which properties should be customizable in the `payload.properties` array in the content.json file.

For each customizable color property, you should define:

1.  The property type (must be “Color”)
2.  The property path (e.g., “fill/solid/color”, “backgroundColor/color”, “dropShadow/color”)
3.  The default value (RGBA color object)
4.  The current value (initially the same as the default)

Example of customizable color properties:

```
"payload": {  "properties": [    {      "type": "Color",      "property": "fill/solid/color",      "value": {        "r": 1,        "g": 1,        "b": 1,        "a": 1      },      "defaultValue": {        "r": 1,        "g": 1,        "b": 1,        "a": 1      }    },    {      "type": "Color",      "property": "backgroundColor/color",      "value": {        "r": 0,        "g": 0,        "b": 0,        "a": 0.5      },      "defaultValue": {        "r": 0,        "g": 0,        "b": 0,        "a": 0.5      }    }  ]}
```

This allows users to modify specific color aspects of a preset without changing the entire style.

## Updating the Content.json File[#](#updating-the-contentjson-file)

Once you have your custom preset files, follow these steps to update the `content.json` file:

1.  Download or create a base `content.json` file if you don’t already have one
2.  Open the file in a text editor or JSON editor
3.  Add new entries to the `assets` array for each of your custom presets
4.  Save the updated file

Here’s an example of what the `content.json` file should look like:

```
{  "version": "3.0.0",  "id": "ly.img.captionPresets",  "assets": [    {      "id": "//ly.img.captionPresets/background",      "label": {        "en": "Background"      },      "meta": {        "uri": "{{base_url}}/ly.img.captionPresets/presets/background.preset",        "thumbUri": "{{base_url}}/ly.img.captionPresets/thumbnails/background.png",        "mimeType": "application/ubq-blocks-string"      },      "payload": {        "properties": [          {            "type": "Color",            "property": "fill/solid/color",            "value": {              "r": 1,              "g": 1,              "b": 1,              "a": 1            },            "defaultValue": {              "r": 1,              "g": 1,              "b": 1,              "a": 1            }          },          {            "type": "Color",            "property": "backgroundColor/color",            "value": {              "r": 0,              "g": 0,              "b": 0,              "a": 0.5            },            "defaultValue": {              "r": 0,              "g": 0,              "b": 0,              "a": 0.5            }          }        ]      }    },    {      "id": "//ly.img.captionPresets/outline",      "label": {        "en": "Outline"      },      "meta": {        "uri": "{{base_url}}/ly.img.captionPresets/presets/outline.preset",        "thumbUri": "{{base_url}}/ly.img.captionPresets/thumbnails/outline.png",        "mimeType": "application/ubq-blocks-string"      },      "payload": {        "properties": [          {            "type": "Color",            "property": "fill/solid/color",            "value": {              "r": 1,              "g": 1,              "b": 1,              "a": 1            },            "defaultValue": {              "r": 1,              "g": 1,              "b": 1,              "a": 1            }          },          {            "type": "Color",            "property": "dropShadow/color",            "value": {              "r": 0,              "g": 0,              "b": 0,              "a": 1            },            "defaultValue": {              "r": 0,              "g": 0,              "b": 0,              "a": 1            }          }        ]      }    }  ]}
```

To add your custom preset, add a new entry to the `assets` array with these required fields:

```
{  "id": "//ly.img.captionPresets/my-custom-preset", // A unique identifier with proper namespace  "label": {    "en": "My Custom Preset" // The name that will appear in the UI  },  "meta": {    "uri": "{{base_url}}/ly.img.captionPresets/presets/my-custom-preset.preset",    "thumbUri": "{{base_url}}/ly.img.captionPresets/thumbnails/my-custom-preset.png",    "mimeType": "application/ubq-blocks-string" // Important: Include this mime type  },  "payload": {    "properties": [      {        "type": "Color",        "property": "fill/solid/color",        "value": {          "r": 1,          "g": 1,          "b": 1,          "a": 1        },        "defaultValue": {          "r": 1,          "g": 1,          "b": 1,          "a": 1        }      },      // Add other properties that can be customized      {        "type": "Color",        "property": "dropShadow/color",        "value": {          "r": 0,          "g": 0,          "b": 0,          "a": 0.8        },        "defaultValue": {          "r": 0,          "g": 0,          "b": 0,          "a": 0.8        }      }    ]  }}
```

## Hosting and Serving Custom Presets[#](#hosting-and-serving-custom-presets)

After updating the content.json file, you need to host the files on your server. Follow these steps:

1.  Create the proper folder structure on your server that matches the standard caption presets organization:
    
    ```
    /assets/v4/ly.img.captionPresets/├── content.json├── presets/│   ├── background.preset│   ├── outline.preset│   ├── my-custom-preset.preset│   └── ...└── thumbnails/    ├── background.png    ├── outline.png    ├── my-custom-preset.png    └── ...
    ```
    
2.  Upload all files to your server, maintaining this exact folder structure:
    
    *   Your updated content.json file should go in the root folder
    *   All .preset files should go in the presets/ folder
    *   All thumbnail images should go in the thumbnails/ folder
3.  Make sure the files are accessible via HTTP/HTTPS and properly configured with CORS headers if needed
    
4.  Test that you can access each file directly via its URL in a browser
    

For more information on hosting assets, see the [asset hosting documentation](nextjs/import-media/from-remote-source-b65faf/).

## Loading Custom Presets into CE.SDK[#](#loading-custom-presets-into-cesdk)

To load your custom caption presets into CE.SDK, you need to tell the engine where to find your updated content.json file. Since CE.SDK already includes a caption presets asset source with the ID “ly.img.captionPresets”, we’ll update this existing source rather than creating a new one.

For that you only have to configure the base URL to the one pointing at the location your assets are being available from:

```
const config = {  baseURL: 'https://yourdomain.com/assets', // Your base assets path};
CreativeEngine.init(config).then(async engine => {  // ...});
```

Your custom presets will seamlessly integrate with any built-in presets and automatically appear in the caption presets panel in the UI.

```

In addition to static designs, CE.SDK also allows you to create and edit videos. Working with videos introduces the concept of time into the scene, which requires you to switch the scene into the `"Video"` mode.

In this mode, each page in the scene has its own separate timeline within which its children can be placed. The `"playback/time"` property of each page controls the progress of time through the page.

In order to add videos to your pages, you can add a block with a `"//ly.img.ubq/fill/video"` fill. As the playback time of the page progresses, the corresponding point in time of the video fill is rendered by the block.

You can also customize the video fill’s trim in order to control the portion of the video that should be looped while the block is visible.

`//ly.img.ubq/audio` blocks can be added to the page in order to play an audio file during playback.

The `playback/timeOffset` property controls after how many seconds the audio should begin to play, while the duration property defines how long the audio should play. The same APIs can be used for other design blocks as well, such as text or graphic blocks.

Finally, the whole page can be exported as a video file using the `block.exportVideo` function.

## A Note on Browser Support[#](#a-note-on-browser-support)

Video mode heavily relies on modern features like web codecs. A detailed list of supported browser versions can be found in our [Supported Browsers](nextjs/browser-support-28c1b0/). Please also take note of possible restrictions based on the host platform browsers are running on.

## Creating a Video Scene[#](#creating-a-video-scene)

First, we create a scene that is set up for video editing by calling the `scene.createVideo()` API. Then we create a page, add it to the scene and define its dimensions. This page will hold our composition.

```
  const scene = engine.scene.createVideo();
  const page = engine.block.create('page');  engine.block.appendChild(scene, page);
  engine.block.setWidth(page, 1280);  engine.block.setHeight(page, 720);
```

## Setting Page Durations[#](#setting-page-durations)

Next, we define the duration of the page using the `setDuration(block: number, duration: number): void` API to be 20 seconds long. This will be the total duration of our exported video in the end.

```
engine.block.setDuration(page, 20);
```

## Adding Videos[#](#adding-videos)

In this example, we want to show two videos, one after the other. For this, we first create two graphic blocks and assign two `'video'` fills to them.

```
  const video1 = engine.block.create('graphic');  engine.block.setShape(video1, engine.block.createShape('rect'));  const videoFill = engine.block.createFill('video');  engine.block.setString(    videoFill,    'fill/video/fileURI',    'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v2/ly.img.video/videos/pexels-drone-footage-of-a-surfer-barrelling-a-wave-12715991.mp4'  );  engine.block.setFill(video1, videoFill);
  const video2 = engine.block.create('graphic');  engine.block.setShape(video2, engine.block.createShape('rect'));  const videoFill2 = engine.block.createFill('video');  engine.block.setString(    videoFill2,    'fill/video/fileURI',    'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v2/ly.img.video/videos/pexels-kampus-production-8154913.mp4'  );  engine.block.setFill(video2, videoFill2);
```

## Creating a Track[#](#creating-a-track)

While we could add the two blocks directly to the page and and manually set their sizes and time offsets, we can alternatively also use the `track` block to simplify this work. A `track` automatically adjusts the time offsets of its children to make sure that they play one after another without any gaps, based on each child’s duration.

Tracks themselves cannot be selected directly by clicking on the canvas, nor do they have any visual representation.

We create a `track` block, add it to the page and add both videos in the order in which they should play as the track’s children. Next, we use the `fillParent` API, which will resize all children of the track to the same dimensions as the page.

The dimensions of a `track` are always derived from the dimensions of its children, so you should not call the `setWidth` or `setHeight` APIs on a track, but on its children instead if you can’t use the `fillParent` API.

```
const track = engine.block.create('track');engine.block.appendChild(page, track);engine.block.appendChild(track, video1);engine.block.appendChild(track, video2);engine.block.fillParent(track);
```

By default, each block has a duration of 5 seconds after it is created. If we want to show it on the page for a different amount of time, we can use the `setDuration` API.

Note that we can just increase the duration of the first video block to 15 seconds without having to adjust anything about the second video. The `track` takes care of that for us automatically so that the second video starts playing after 15 seconds.

```
engine.block.setDuration(video1, 15);
```

If the video is longer than the duration of the graphic block that it’s attached to, it will cut off once the duration of the graphic is reached. If it is too short, the video will automatically loop for as long as its graphic block is visible.

We can also manually define the portion of our video that should loop within the graphic using the `setTrimOffset(block: number, offset: number): void` and `setTrimLength(block: number, length: number): void` APIs. We use the trim offset to cut away the first second of the video and the trim length to only play 10 seconds of the video. Since our graphic is 15 seconds long, the trimmed video will be played fully once and then start looping for the remaining 5 seconds.

```
/* Make sure that the video is loaded before calling the trim APIs. */await engine.block.forceLoadAVResource(videoFill);engine.block.setTrimOffset(videoFill, 1);engine.block.setTrimLength(videoFill, 10);
```

We can control if a video will loop back to its beginning by calling `setLooping(block: number, looping: boolean): void`. Otherwise, the video will simply hold its last frame instead and audio will stop playing. Looping behavior is activated for all blocks by default.

```
engine.block.setLooping(videoFill, true);
```

## Audio[#](#audio)

If the video of a video fill contains an audio track, that audio will play automatically by default when the video is playing. We can mute it by calling `setMuted(block: number, muted: boolean): void`.

```
engine.block.setMuted(videoFill, true);
```

We can also add audio-only files to play together with the contents of the page by adding an `'audio'` block to the page and assigning it the URL of the audio file.

```
const audio = engine.block.create('audio');engine.block.appendChild(page, audio);engine.block.setString(  audio,  'audio/fileURI',  'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v1/ly.img.audio/audios/far_from_home.m4a');
```

We can adjust the volume level of any audio block or video fill by calling `setVolume(block: number, volume: number): void`. The volume is given as a fraction in the range of 0 to 1.

```
/* Set the volume level to 70%. */engine.block.setVolume(audio, 0.7);
```

By default, our audio block will start playing at the very beginning of the page. We can change this by specifying how many seconds into the scene it should begin to play using the `setTimeOffset(block: number, offset: number): void` API.

```
/* Start the audio after two seconds of playback. */engine.block.setTimeOffset(audio, 2);
```

By default, our audio block will have a duration of 5 seconds. We can change this by specifying its duration in seconds by using the `setDuration(block: number, duration: number): void` API.

```
/* Give the Audio block a duration of 7 seconds. */engine.block.setDuration(audio, 7);
```

## Exporting Video[#](#exporting-video)

You can start exporting the entire page as a video file by calling `exportVideo()`. The encoding process will run in the background. You can get notified about the progress of the encoding process by the `progressCallback`. It will be called whenever another frame has been encoded.

Since the encoding process runs in the background the engine will stay interactive. So, you can continue to use the engine to manipulate the scene. Please note that these changes won’t be visible in the exported video file because the scene’s state has been frozen at the start of the export.

```
  /* Export page as mp4 video. */  const videoBlob = await engine.block.exportVideo(page, {    mimeType: 'video/mp4',    onProgress: (renderedFrames, encodedFrames, totalFrames) => {      console.log(        'Rendered',        renderedFrames,        'frames and encoded',        encodedFrames,        'frames out of',        totalFrames      );    }  });
  /* Download video blob. */  let anchor = document.createElement('a');  anchor.href = URL.createObjectURL(videoBlob);  anchor.download = 'exported-video.mp4';  anchor.click();

## Exporting Audio[#](#exporting-audio)

You can export just the audio from your video scene by calling `exportAudio()`. This allows you to extract the audio track separately, whether from an entire page, a single audio block, a video block with audio, or a track containing multiple audio sources.

The audio export process runs in a background worker, similar to video export, keeping the main engine responsive. You can monitor the progress through the `onProgress` callback.

```
  /* Export page audio as an WAV audio. */  const audioBlob = await engine.block.exportAudio(page, {    mimeType: 'audio/wav',    onProgress: (renderedFrames, encodedFrames, totalFrames) => {      console.log(        'Rendered',        renderedFrames,        'frames and encoded',        encodedFrames,        'frames out of',        totalFrames      );    }  });
  /* Download audio blob. */  anchor = document.createElement('a');  anchor.href = URL.createObjectURL(audioBlob);  anchor.download = 'exported-audio.wav';  anchor.click();
```

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to configure and control audio and video through the `block` API.

## Time Offset and Duration[#](#time-offset-and-duration)

The time offset determines when a block becomes active during playback on the page’s timeline, and the duration decides how long this block is active. Blocks within tracks are a special case in that they have an implicitly calculated time offset that is determined by their order and the total duration of their preceding blocks in the same track. As with any audio/video-related property, not every block supports these properties. Use `supportsTimeOffset` and `supportsDuration` to check.

```
supportsTimeOffset(id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Returns whether the block has a time offset property.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns true, if the block has a time offset property.

```
setTimeOffset(id: DesignBlockId, offset: number): void
```

Set the time offset of the given block relative to its parent. The time offset controls when the block is first active in the timeline. The time offset is not supported by the page block.

*   `id`: The block whose time offset should be changed.
*   `offset`: The new time offset in seconds.

```
getTimeOffset(id: DesignBlockId): number
```

Get the time offset of the given block relative to its parent.

*   `id`: The block whose time offset should be queried.
*   Returns the time offset of the block.

```
supportsDuration(id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Returns whether the block has a duration property.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns true if the block has a duration property.

```
setDuration(id: DesignBlockId, duration: number): void
```

Set the playback duration of the given block in seconds. The duration defines for how long the block is active in the scene during playback. If a duration is set on the page block, it becomes the duration source block. The duration is ignored when the scene is not in “Video” mode. Note: This also adjusts the trim for non looping blocks.

*   `id`: The block whose duration should be changed.
*   `duration`: The new duration in seconds.

```
getDuration(id: DesignBlockId): number
```

Get the playback duration of the given block in seconds. The duration defines for how long the block is active in the scene during playback. Note: The duration is ignored when the scene is not in `Video` mode.

*   `id`: The block whose duration should be returned.
*   Returns The block’s duration.

```
supportsPageDurationSource(page: DesignBlockId, id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Returns whether the block can be marked as the element that defines the duration of the given page.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns true, if the block can be marked as the element that defines the duration of the given page.

```
setPageDurationSource(page: DesignBlockId, id: DesignBlockId): void
```

Set an block as duration source so that the overall page duration is automatically determined by this. If no defining block is set, the page duration is calculated over all children. Only one block per page can be marked as duration source. Will automatically unmark the previously marked. Note: This is only supported for blocks that have a duration.

*   `page`: The page block for which it should be enabled.
*   `id`: The block that should be updated.

```
isPageDurationSource(id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Query whether the block is a duration source block for the page.

*   `id`: The block whose duration source property should be queried.
*   Returns If the block is a duration source for a page.

```
removePageDurationSource(id: DesignBlockId): void
```

Remove the block as duration source block for the page. If a scene or page is given as block, it is deactivated for all blocks in the scene or page.

*   `id`: The block whose duration source property should be removed.

```
setNativePixelBuffer(id: number, buffer: HTMLCanvasElement | HTMLVideoElement): void
```

Update the pixels of the given pixel stream fill block.

*   `id`: The pixel stream fill block.
*   `buffer`: Use pixel data from a canvas or a video element.

## Trim[#](#trim)

You can select a specific range of footage from your audio/video resource by providing a trim offset and a trim length. The footage will loop if the trim’s length is shorter than the block’s duration. This behavior can also be disabled using the `setLooping` function.

```
supportsTrim(id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Returns whether the block has trim properties.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns true, if the block has trim properties.

```
setTrimOffset(id: DesignBlockId, offset: number): void
```

Set the trim offset of the given block or fill. Sets the time in seconds within the fill at which playback of the audio or video clip should begin. This requires the video or audio clip to be loaded.

*   `id`: The block whose trim should be updated.
*   `offset`: The new trim offset, measured in timeline seconds (scaled by playback rate).

```
getTrimOffset(id: DesignBlockId): number
```

Get the trim offset of this block. \* This requires the video or audio clip to be loaded.

*   `id`: The block whose trim offset should be queried.
*   Returns the trim offset in timeline seconds.

```
setTrimLength(id: DesignBlockId, length: number): void
```

Set the trim length of the given block or fill. The trim length is the duration of the audio or video clip that should be used for playback. After reaching this value during playback, the trim region will loop. This requires the video or audio clip to be loaded.

*   `id`: The object whose trim length should be updated.
*   `length`: The new trim length, measured in timeline seconds (scaled by playback rate).

```
getTrimLength(id: DesignBlockId): number
```

Get the trim length of the given block or fill.

*   `id`: The object whose trim length should be queried.
*   Returns The trim length of the object measured in timeline seconds (scaled by playback rate).

## Playback Control[#](#playback-control)

You can start and pause playback and seek to a certain point on the scene’s timeline. There’s also a solo playback mode to preview audio and video blocks individually while the rest of the scene stays frozen. Finally, you can enable or disable the looping behavior of blocks and control their audio volume.

```
setPlaying(id: DesignBlockId, enabled: boolean): void
```

Set whether the block should be playing during active playback.

*   `id`: The block that should be updated.
*   `enabled`: Whether the block should be playing its contents.

```
setSoloPlaybackEnabled(id: DesignBlockId, enabled: boolean): void
```

Set whether the given block or fill should play its contents while the rest of the scene remains paused. Setting this to true for one block will automatically set it to false on all other blocks.

*   `id`: The block or fill to update.
*   `enabled`: Whether the block’s playback should progress as time moves on.

```
isSoloPlaybackEnabled(id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Return whether the given block or fill is currently set to play its contents while the rest of the scene remains paused.

*   `id`: The block or fill to query.
*   Returns Whether solo playback is enabled for this block.

```
supportsPlaybackTime(id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Returns whether the block has a playback time property.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns whether the block has a playback time property.

```
setPlaybackTime(id: DesignBlockId, time: number): void
```

*   `time`: The new playback time of the block in seconds.

```
getPlaybackTime(id: DesignBlockId): number
```

Get the playback time of the given block.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns the playback time of the block in seconds.

```
isVisibleAtCurrentPlaybackTime(id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Returns whether the block should be visible on the canvas at the current playback time.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns Whether the block should be visible on the canvas at the current playback time.

```
supportsPlaybackControl(id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Returns whether the block supports a playback control.

```

Set whether the block should restart from the beginning again or stop.

*   `block`: The block or video fill to update.
*   `looping`: Whether the block should loop to the beginning or stop.

```
isLooping(id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Query whether the block is looping.

*   `block`: The block to query.
*   Returns Whether the block is looping.

```
setMuted(id: DesignBlockId, muted: boolean): void
```

Set whether the audio of the block is muted.

*   `block`: The block or video fill to update.
*   `muted`: Whether the audio should be muted.

```
isMuted(id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Query whether the block is muted.

*   `block`: The block to query.
*   Returns Whether the block is muted.

```
setVolume(id: DesignBlockId, volume: number): void
```

getVideoHeight(id: DesignBlockId): number
```

Get the video height in pixels of the video resource that is attached to the given block.

*   `block`: The video fill.
*   Returns The video height in pixels or an error.

## Playback Speed[#](#playback-speed)

You can control the playback speed of audio and video blocks to create slow-motion or fast-forward effects. The playback speed is a multiplier that affects how quickly the content plays back, with values ranging from 0.25x (quarter speed) to 3.0x (triple speed).

Note that changing the playback speed automatically adjusts both the trim and duration of the block to maintain the same visual timeline length.

```
setPlaybackSpeed(id: DesignBlockId, speed: number): void
```

Set the playback speed of the given block.

Note: This also adjusts the trim and duration of the block.

*   `id`: The block or video fill to update.

```
getPlaybackSpeed(id: DesignBlockId): number
```

Get the playback speed of the given block.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns: The playback speed multiplier.

## Resource Control[#](#resource-control)

Until an audio/video resource referenced by a block is loaded, properties like the duration of the resource aren’t available, and accessing those will lead to an error. You can avoid this by forcing the resource you want to access to load using `forceLoadAVResource`.

```
forceLoadAVResource(id: DesignBlockId): Promise<void>
```

Begins loading the required audio and video resource for the given video fill or audio block. If the resource had been loaded earlier and resulted in an error, it will be reloaded.

*   `id`: The video fill or audio block whose resource should be loaded.
*   Returns A Promise that resolves once the resource has finished loading.

```
unstable_isAVResourceLoaded(id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Returns whether the audio and video resource for the given video fill or audio block is loaded.

*   `id`: The video fill or audio block.
*   Returns The loading state of the resource.

```
getAVResourceTotalDuration(id: DesignBlockId): number
```

Get the duration in seconds of the video or audio resource that is attached to the given block.

*   `id`: The video fill or audio block.
*   Returns The video or audio file duration.

## Thumbnail Previews[#](#thumbnail-previews)

For a user interface, it can be helpful to have image previews in the form of thumbnails for any given video resource. For videos, the engine can provide one or more frames using `generateVideoThumbnailSequence`. Pass the video fill that references the video resource. In addition to video thumbnails, the engine can also render compositions of design blocks over time. To do this pass in the respective design block. The video editor uses these to visually represent blocks in the timeline.

In order to visualize audio signals `generateAudioThumbnailSequence` can be used. This generates a sequence of values in the range of 0 to 1 that represent the loudness of the signal. These values can be used to render a waveform pattern in any custom style.

Note: There can be at most one thumbnail generation request per block at any given time. If you don’t want to wait for the request to finish before issuing a new request, you can cancel it by calling the returned function.

```
generateVideoThumbnailSequence(id: DesignBlockId, thumbnailHeight: number, timeBegin: number, timeEnd: number, numberOfFrames: number, onFrame: (frameIndex: number, result: ImageData | Error) => void): () => void
```

Generate a sequence of thumbnails for the given video fill or design block. Note: There can only be one thumbnail generation request in progress for a given block. Note: During playback, the thumbnail generation will be paused.

*   `id`: The video fill or design block.
*   `thumbnailHeight`: The height of a thumbnail. The width will be calculated from the video aspect ratio.
*   `timeBegin`: The time in seconds relative to the time offset of the design block at which the thumbnail sequence should start.
*   `timeEnd`: The time in seconds relative to the time offset of the design block at which the thumbnail sequence should end.
*   `numberOfFrames`: The number of frames to generate.
*   `onFrame`: Gets passed the frame index and RGBA image data.
*   Returns A method that will cancel any thumbnail generation request in progress for this block.

```
generateAudioThumbnailSequence(id: DesignBlockId, samplesPerChunk: number, timeBegin: number, timeEnd: number, numberOfSamples: number, numberOfChannels: number, onChunk: (chunkIndex: number, result: Float32Array | Error) => void): () => void
```

Generate a thumbnail sequence for the given audio block or video fill. A thumbnail in this case is a chunk of samples in the range of 0 to 1. In case stereo data is requested, the samples are interleaved, starting with the left channel. Note During playback, the thumbnail generation will be paused.

*   `id`: The audio block or video fill.
*   `samplesPerChunk`: The number of samples per chunk. `onChunk` is called when this many samples are ready.
*   `timeBegin`: The time in seconds at which the thumbnail sequence should start.
*   `timeEnd`: The time in seconds at which the thumbnail sequence should end.
*   `numberOfSamples`: The total number of samples to generate.
*   `numberOfChannels`: The number of channels in the output. 1 for mono, 2 for stereo.
*   `onChunk`: This gets passed an index and a chunk of samples whenever it’s ready, or an error.

# Overview

In CE.SDK, a _template_ is a reusable, structured design that defines editable areas and constraints for end users. Templates can be based on static visuals or video compositions and are used to guide content creation, enable mass personalization, and enforce design consistency.

Unlike a regular editable design, a template introduces structure through placeholders and constraints, allowing you to define which elements users can change and how. Templates support both static output formats (like PNG, PDF) and videos (like MP4), and can be created or applied using either the CE.SDK UI or API.

Templates are a core part of enabling design automation, personalization, and streamlined workflows in any app that includes creative functionality.

## Why Use Templates?[#](#why-use-templates)

Templates are a powerful tool for:

*   Maintaining **brand consistency** across all user-generated designs.
*   **Scaling** asset creation for campaigns, catalogs, or print products.
*   Providing a **guided experience** where users adapt content without starting from scratch.

They are ideal for use cases like:

*   Personalized marketing campaigns
*   Dynamic social media ads
*   Product catalogs and e-commerce visuals
*   Custom print materials and photo books

## Ways to Create Templates[#](#ways-to-create-templates)

You can create templates from scratch or by importing an existing template.

**From Scratch:** Start a new project and design a scene with the intent of turning it into a template. You can define variables, placeholders, and constraints directly in the editor.

**Import Existing Designs:** If you already have assets created in other tools, you can import them as templates.

| Format | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.idml` | InDesign |
| `.psd` | Photoshop |
| `.scene` | CE.SDK Native |

Need to import a format not listed here? CE.SDK allows you to create custom importers for any file type by using our Scene and Block APIs to generate scenes programmatically.

These imported designs can then be adapted into editable, structured templates inside CE.SDK.

## Dynamic Content in Templates[#](#dynamic-content-in-templates)

Templates support dynamic content to enable data-driven generation of assets. CE.SDK provides several mechanisms:

*   **Text Variables**: Bind text elements to dynamic values (e.g., user names, product SKUs).
*   **Image Placeholders**: Reserve space for images to be inserted later.
*   **Video Placeholders**: Reserve space for videos, enabling dynamic insertion of video clips in a templated layout.

This makes it easy to generate hundreds or thousands of personalized variations from a single design.

## Controlling Template Editing[#](#controlling-template-editing)

Templates in CE.SDK offer powerful tools for controlling the editing experience:

*   **Editing Constraints**: Lock specific properties such as position, style, or content of elements.
*   **Locked Templates**: Prevent any edits outside allowed fields to protect design integrity.
*   **Fully Editable Templates**: Allow unrestricted editing for power users or advanced workflows.
*   **Form-Based Editing**: Build a custom editing interface for users to fill in variables and placeholders via input forms (a ready-made UI is not currently provided, but can be built using our APIs).

These options let you strike a balance between creative freedom and design control.

## Working with Templates Programmatically and Through the UI[#](#working-with-templates-programmatically-and-through-the-ui)

You can manage templates using both the UI and API:

*   **UI Integration**: Users can select, apply, and edit templates directly inside the CE.SDK interface.
*   **Programmatic Access**: Use the SDK’s APIs to create, apply, or modify templates as part of an automated workflow.
*   **Asset Library Integration**: Templates can appear in the asset library, allowing users to browse and pick templates visually.
    *   The Asset Library’s appearance and behavior can be fully customized to fit your app’s needs.

## Managing Templates[#](#managing-templates)

Templates are saved and reused just like any other CE.SDK asset:

*   **Save Templates** to a _Template Library_.
*   **Edit or Remove** existing templates from your asset library.
*   Templates are saved as Scene (`.scene`) or Archive (`.zip`) files and can be loaded across all platforms supported by CE.SDK (Web, Mobile, Server, Desktop)

## Default and Premium Templates[#](#default-and-premium-templates)

*   **Default Templates**: CE.SDK may include a small number of starter templates depending on your configuration.
*   **Premium Templates**: IMG.LY offers a growing collection of professionally designed templates available for licensing.
*   Templates can be imported, customized, and used directly within your app.

Check your license or speak with our team for details on accessing premium templates.

## Templates as Assets[#](#templates-as-assets)

Templates are treated as **assets** in CE.SDK. That means:

*   They can be included in local or remote asset libraries.
*   They can be shared, versioned, and indexed using the same systems as images or videos.
*   You can apply your own metadata, tags, and search capabilities to them.

# Create From Scratch

To make the templates you created available to users, you need to create an asset source. This example shows the minimal amount of code you need to write to have your templates appear in the Asset Library. For a more complete description of the different ways you can configure the asset library, take a look at the [customize asset library guide](nextjs/import-media/asset-panel/customize-c9a4de/).

### Add local asset source[#](#add-local-asset-source)

Add a local asset source, using an arbitrary id that identifies the asset source. In this case the asset source id is `my-templates`.

```
cesdk.engine.asset.addLocalSource(  'my-templates',  undefined,  function applyAsset(asset) {    cesdk.engine.scene.applyTemplateFromURL(asset.meta.uri);  },);
```

### applyAsset()[#](#applyasset)

Assets that the user has chosen from the asset library are passed to the `applyAsset` function.

This function determines what to do with the selected asset. In our case we want to apply it to the scene using the [scene API](nextjs/concepts/scenes-e8596d/). Note that you can access the entire asset object here. This means you can use it to store and process arbitrary information in the `meta` property. In this example, we are passing a URI to a template file, but you could also pass an internal identifier, a serialized scene string, or additional data to further modify or process the template using the available API methods.

```
function applyAsset(asset) {  cesdk.engine.scene.applyTemplateFromURL(asset.meta.uri);}
```

### Source Id[#](#source-id)

Every asset source needs a source id. Which one you chose does not really matter, as long as it is unique.

```
    'my-templates',    undefined,
```

### Add template assets to the source[#](#add-template-assets-to-the-source)

Every template asset should have four different properties:

*   `id: string` needs to be a uniqe identifier. It is mainly used internally and can be chosen arbitrarily.
*   `label: string` describes the template and is being rendered inside the template library via tooltip and as ARIA label.
*   `meta.thumbUri: string` pointing to a thumbnail source. Thumbnails are used in the template library shown in the inspector and should ideally have a width of 400px for landscape images. Keep in mind, that a large number of large thumbnails may slow down the library.
*   `meta.uri: string` provides the scene to load, when selecting the template. This can either be a raw scene string starting with `UBQ1`, an absolute or relative URL pointing at a scene file, or an async function that returns a scene string upon resolve.

```
cesdk.engine.asset.addAssetToSource('my-templates', {  id: 'template1',  label: 'Template 1',  meta: {    uri: `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}/template.scene`,    thumbUri: `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}/template_thumb.png`,  },});
```

### UI Config[#](#ui-config)

It is not enough to add the asset source to the Creative Engine. You also need to configure how the asset source will appear in the asset library. For more information, see the [asset library guide](nextjs/import-media/asset-panel/customize-c9a4de/). In this example we provide the minimal configuration to have the template library we just created appear.

```
cesdk.ui.addAssetLibraryEntry({  id: 'my-templates-entry',  sourceIds: ['my-templates'],  sceneMode: 'Design',  previewLength: 5,  previewBackgroundType: 'cover',  gridBackgroundType: 'cover',  gridColumns: 3,});cesdk.ui.setDockOrder([  {    id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock',    key: 'my-templates-dock-entry',    label: 'My Templates',    icon: '@imgly/Template',    entries: ['my-templates-entry'],  },]);
```

## Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here’s the full code:

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',  userId: 'guides-user',  baseURL: 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/assets',};
CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk_container', config).then(async cesdk => {  cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({    sceneMode: 'Design',    withUploadAssetSources: true,  });  cesdk.engine.asset.addLocalSource(    'my-templates',    undefined,    function applyAsset(asset) {      cesdk.engine.scene.applyTemplateFromURL(asset.meta.uri);    },  );  cesdk.engine.asset.addAssetToSource('my-templates', {    id: 'template1',    label: 'Template 1',    meta: {      uri: `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}/template.scene`,      thumbUri: `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}/template_thumb.png`,    },  });  cesdk.ui.addAssetLibraryEntry({    id: 'my-templates-entry',    sourceIds: ['my-templates'],    sceneMode: 'Design',    previewLength: 5,    previewBackgroundType: 'cover',    gridBackgroundType: 'cover',    gridColumns: 3,  });  cesdk.ui.setDockOrder([    {      id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock',      key: 'my-templates-dock-entry',      label: 'My Templates',      icon: '@imgly/Template',      entries: ['my-templates-entry'],    },  ]);  cesdk.createDesignScene();});

  /* This will return true as well since the global scope is set to 'Defer'. */  engine.block.isAllowedByScope(block, 'layer/move');
  // Attach engine canvas to DOM  document.getElementById('cesdk_container').append(engine.element);});
```

```
<!doctype html><html lang="en">  <head>    <meta charset="UTF-8" />    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />    <style>      body {        margin: 0;        overflow: hidden;      }      html {        overscroll-behavior-x: contain;      }    </style>  </head>
  <body>    <div id="cesdk_container" style="width: 100%; height: 100vh"></div>    <script type="module" src="index.js"></script>  </body></html>
```

CE.SDK allows you to control which parts of a block can be manipulated. Scopes describe different aspects of a block, e.g. layout or style and can be enabled or disabled for every single block. There’s also the option to control a scope globally. When configuring a scope globally you can set an override to always allow or deny a certain type of manipulation for every block. Or you can configure the global scope to defer to the individual block scopes.

Initially, the block-level scopes are all disabled while at the global level all scopes are set to `"Allow"`. This overrides the block-level and allows for any kind of manipulation.

If you want to implement a limited editing mode in your software you can set the desired scopes on the blocks you want the user to manipulate and then restrict the available actions by globally setting the scopes to `"Defer"`. In the same way you can prevent any manipulation of properties covered by a scope by setting the respective global scope to `"Deny"`.

## Available Scopes[#](#available-scopes)

You can retrieve all available scopes by calling `editor.findAllScopes()`.

```
const scopes = engine.editor.findAllScopes();
```

We currently support the following scopes:

| Scope | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `"layer/move"` | Whether the block’s position can be changed |
| `"layer/resize"` | Whether the block can be resized |
| `"layer/rotate"` | Whether the block’s rotation can be changed |
| `"layer/flip"` | Whether the block can be flipped |
| `"layer/crop"` | Whether the block’s content can be cropped |
| `"layer/clipping"` | Whether the block’s clipping can be changed |
| `"layer/opacity"` | Whether the block’s opacity can be changed |
| `"layer/blendMode"` | Whether the block’s blend mode can be changed |
| `"layer/visibility"` | Whether the block’s visibility can be changed |
| `"appearance/adjustments"` | Whether the block’s adjustments can be changed |
| `"appearance/filter"` | Whether the block’s filter can be changed |
| `"appearance/effect"` | Whether the block’s effect can be changed |
| `"appearance/blur"` | Whether the block’s blur can be changed |
| `"appearance/shadow"` | Whether the block’s shadow can be changed |
| `"lifecycle/destroy"` | Whether the block can be deleted |
| `"lifecycle/duplicate"` | Whether the block can be duplicated |
| `"editor/add"` | Whether new blocks can be added |
| `"editor/select"` | Whether a block can be selected or not |
| `"fill/change"` | Whether the block’s fill can be changed |
| `"fill/changeType"` | Whether the block’s fill type can be changed |
| `"stroke/change"` | Whether the block’s stroke can be changed |
| `"shape/change"` | Whether the block’s shape can be changed |
| `"text/edit"` | Whether the block’s text can be changed |
| `"text/character"` | Whether the block’s text properties can be changed |

## Managing Scopes[#](#managing-scopes)

First, we globally defer the `'layer/move'` scope to the block-level using `editor.setGlobalScope('layer/move', 'Defer')`. Since all blocks default to having their scopes set to `false` initially, modifying the layout properties of any block will fail at this point.

| Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `"Allow"` | Manipulation of properties covered by the scope is always allowed |
| `"Deny"` | Manipulation of properties covered by the scope is always denied |
| `"Defer"` | Permission is deferred to the scope of the individual blocks |

```
  /* Let the global scope defer to the block-level. */  engine.editor.setGlobalScope('layer/move', 'Defer');
  /* Manipulation of layout properties of any block will fail at this point. */  try {    engine.block.setPositionX(block, 100); // Not allowed  } catch (err) {    console.log(err.message);  }
```

We can verify the current state of the global `'layer/move'` scope using `editor.getGlobalScope('layer/move')`.

```
/* This will return 'Defer'. */engine.editor.getGlobalScope('layer/move');
```

Now we can allow the `'layer/move'` scope for a single block by setting it to `true` using `block.setScopeEnabled(block: number, key: string, enabled: boolean)`.

```
  /* Allow the user to control the layout properties of the image block. */  engine.block.setScopeEnabled(block, 'layer/move', true);
  /* Manipulation of layout properties of any block is now allowed. */  try {    engine.block.setPositionX(block, 100); // Allowed  } catch (err) {    console.log(err.message);  }
```

Again we can verify this change by calling `block.isScopeEnabled(block: number, key: string): boolean`.

```
/* Verify that the 'layer/move' scope is now enabled for the image block. */engine.block.isScopeEnabled(block, 'layer/move');
```

Finally, `block.isAllowedByScope(block: number, key: string): boolean` will allow us to verify a block’s final scope state by taking both the global state as well as block-level state into account.

```
/* This will return true as well since the global scope is set to 'Defer'. */engine.block.isAllowedByScope(block, 'layer/move');
```

## Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here’s the full code:

```
import CreativeEngine from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',  userId: 'guides-user',  baseURL:    'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/assets',};
CreativeEngine.init(config).then(async engine => {  let scene = await engine.scene.createFromImage(    'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/imgly_logo.jpg',  );  const block = engine.block.findByType('graphic')[0];
  const scopes = engine.editor.findAllScopes();
  /* Let the global scope defer to the block-level. */  engine.editor.setGlobalScope('layer/move', 'Defer');
  /* Manipulation of layout properties of any block will fail at this point. */  try {    engine.block.setPositionX(block, 100); // Not allowed  } catch (err) {    console.log(err.message);  }
  /* This will return 'Defer'. */  engine.editor.getGlobalScope('layer/move');
  /* Allow the user to control the layout properties of the image block. */  engine.block.setScopeEnabled(block, 'layer/move', true);
  /* Manipulation of layout properties of any block is now allowed. */  try {    engine.block.setPositionX(block, 100); // Allowed  } catch (err) {    console.log(err.message);  }
  /* Verify that the 'layer/move' scope is now enabled for the image block. */  engine.block.isScopeEnabled(block, 'layer/move');
  /* This will return true as well since the global scope is set to 'Defer'. */  engine.block.isAllowedByScope(block, 'layer/move');
  // Attach engine canvas to DOM  document.getElementById('cesdk_container').append(engine.element);});

# Group and Ungroup Objects

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to group blocks through the `block` API. Groups form a cohesive unit.

Groups are not currently available when editing videos.

## Grouping[#](#grouping)

Multiple blocks can be grouped together to form a cohesive unit. A group being a block, it can itself be part of a group.

**What cannot be grouped**

*   A scene
*   A block that already is part of a group

```
isGroupable(ids: DesignBlockId[]): boolean
```

Confirms that a given set of blocks can be grouped together.

*   `ids`: An array of block ids.
*   Returns Whether the blocks can be grouped together.

```
group(ids: DesignBlockId[]): DesignBlockId
```

Group blocks together.

*   `ids`: A non-empty array of block ids.
*   Returns The block id of the created group.

```
ungroup(id: DesignBlockId): void
```

Ungroups a group.

*   `id`: The group id from a previous call to `group`.

```
enterGroup(id: DesignBlockId): void
```

Changes selection from selected group to a block within that group. Nothing happens if `group` is not a group. Required scope: ‘editor/select’

*   `id`: The group id from a previous call to `group`.

```
enterGroup(id: DesignBlockId): void
```

Changes selection from selected group to a block within that group. Nothing happens if `group` is not a group. Required scope: ‘editor/select’

*   `id`: The group id from a previous call to `group`.

```
exitGroup(id: DesignBlockId): void
```

Changes selection from a group’s selected block to that group. Nothing happens if the `id` is not part of a group. Required scope: ‘editor/select’

*   `id`: A block id.

## Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here’s the full code:

```
// Create blocks and append to pageconst member1 = engine.block.create('graphic');const member2 = engine.block.create('graphic');engine.block.appendChild(page, member1);engine.block.appendChild(page, member2);
// Check whether the blocks may be groupedconst groupable = engine.block.isGroupable([member1, member2]);if (groupable) {  const group = engine.block.group([member1, member2]);  engine.block.setSelected(group, true);  engine.block.enterGroup(group);  engine.block.setSelected(member1, true);  engine.block.exitGroup(member1);  engine.block.ungroup(group);}
```

[Source](https:/img.ly/docs/cesdk/nextjs/create-composition/blend-modes-ad3519)

# Blend Modes

```
engine.block.supportsOpacity(image);engine.block.setOpacity(image, 0.5);engine.block.getOpacity(image);
engine.block.supportsBlendMode(image);engine.block.setBlendMode(image, 'Multiply');engine.block.getBlendMode(image);
```

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to modify a blocks appearance through the `block` API.

## Common Properties[#](#common-properties)

Common properties are properties that occur on multiple block types. For instance, fill color properties are available for all the shape blocks and the text block. That’s why we built convenient setter and getter functions for these properties. So you don’t have to use the generic setters and getters and don’t have to provide a specific property path. There are also `has*` functions to query if a block supports a set of common properties.

### Opacity[#](#opacity)

Set the translucency of the entire block.

```
supportsOpacity(id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Query if the given block has an opacity.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns true, if the block has an opacity.

```
setOpacity(id: DesignBlockId, opacity: number): void
```

Set the opacity of the given design block. Required scope: ‘layer/opacity’

*   `id`: The block whose opacity should be set.
*   `opacity`: The opacity to be set. The valid range is 0 to 1.

```
getOpacity(id: DesignBlockId): number
```

Get the opacity of the given design block.

*   `id`: The block whose opacity should be queried.
*   Returns The opacity.

### Blend Mode[#](#blend-mode)

Define the blending behavior of a block.

```
supportsBlendMode(id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Query if the given block has a blend mode.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns true, if the block has a blend mode.

```
setBlendMode(id: DesignBlockId, blendMode: BlendMode): void
```

Set the blend mode of the given design block. Required scope: ‘layer/blendMode’

*   `id`: The block whose blend mode should be set.
*   `blendMode`: The blend mode to be set.
*   Returns

```
getBlendMode(id: DesignBlockId): BlendMode
```

Get the blend mode of the given design block.

*   `id`: The block whose blend mode should be queried.
*   Returns The blend mode.

```
type BlendMode =  | 'PassThrough'  | 'Normal'  | 'Darken'  | 'Multiply'  | 'ColorBurn'  | 'Lighten'  | 'Screen'  | 'ColorDodge'  | 'Overlay'  | 'SoftLight'  | 'HardLight'  | 'Difference'  | 'Exclusion'  | 'Hue'  | 'Saturation'  | 'Color'  | 'Luminosity';
```

## Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here’s the full code:

```
engine.block.supportsOpacity(image);engine.block.setOpacity(image, 0.5);engine.block.getOpacity(image);

# Layer Management

```
engine.block.insertChild(page, block, 0);const parent = engine.block.getParent(block);const childIds = engine.block.getChildren(block);engine.block.appendChild(parent, block);
```

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to modify the hierarchy of blocks through the `block` API.

## Manipulate the hierarchy of blocks[#](#manipulate-the-hierarchy-of-blocks)

Only blocks that are direct or indirect children of a `page` block are rendered. Scenes without any `page` child may not be properly displayed by the CE.SDK editor.

```
getParent(id: DesignBlockId): DesignBlockId | null
```

Query a block’s parent.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns The parent’s handle or null if the block has no parent.

```
getChildren(id: DesignBlockId): DesignBlockId[]
```

Get all children of the given block. Children are sorted in their rendering order: Last child is rendered in front of other children.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns A list of block ids.

```
insertChild(parent: DesignBlockId, child: DesignBlockId, index: number): void
```

Insert a new or existing child at a certain position in the parent’s children. Required scope: ‘editor/add’

*   `parent`: The block whose children should be updated.

# To PDF

The CE.SDK allows you to convert JPEG, PNG, WebP, BMP and SVG images into PDFs directly in the browser—no server-side processing required. You can perform this conversion programmatically or through the user interface.

The CE.SDK supports converting single or multiple images to PDF while allowing transformations such as cropping, rotating, and adding text before exporting. You can also customize PDF output settings, including resolution, compatibility and underlayer.

## Convert to PDF Programmatically[#](#convert-to-pdf-programmatically)

You can use the CE.SDK to load an image, apply basic edits, and export it as a PDF programmatically. The following examples demonstrate how to convert a single image and how to merge multiple images into a single PDF.

### Convert a Single Image to PDF[#](#convert-a-single-image-to-pdf)

The example below loads an image, applies transformations, and exports it as a PDF:

```
// Prepare an image URLconst imageURL = 'https://example.com/image.jpg';
// Create a new scene by loading the image immediatelyawait instance.createFromImage(image);
// Find the automatically added graphic block with an image fillconst block = engine.block.findByType('graphic')[0];
// Apply crop with a scale ratio of 2.0engine.block.setCropScaleRatio(block, 2.0);
// Export as PDF Blobconst page = engine.scene.getCurrentPage();const blob = await engine.block.export(page, { mimeType: 'application/pdf' });// You can now save it or display it in your application
```

### Combine Multiple Images into a Single PDF[#](#combine-multiple-images-into-a-single-pdf)

The example below demonstrates how to merge multiple images into a single PDF document:

```
// Prepare image URLsconst images = [  'https://example.com/image1.jpg',  'https://example.com/image2.png',  'https://example.com/image3.webp',];
// Create an empty scene with a 'VerticalStack' layoutconst scene = await engine.scene.create('VerticalStack');const [stack] = engine.block.findByType('stack');
// Load all images as pagesfor (const image of images) {  // Append the new page to the stack  const page = engine.block.create('page');  engine.block.appendChild(stack, page);  // Set the image as the fill of the page  const imageFill = engine.block.createFill('image');  engine.block.setString(imageFill, 'fill/image/imageFileURI', image);  engine.block.setFill(page, imageFill);}
// Export all images as a single PDF blobconst blob = await engine.block.export(scene, { mimeType: 'application/pdf' });// You can now save it or display it in your application
```

## PDF Conversion via the User Interface[#](#pdf-conversion-via-the-user-interface)

The CE.SDK allows you to enable PDF conversion directly from the user interface. You can customize the UI to include a “Convert to PDF” button, allowing users to trigger conversion to PDF after they upload images and perform any edits or adjustments.

## Enable PDF Conversion in the UI[#](#enable-pdf-conversion-in-the-ui)

To modify the UI and add a “Convert to PDF” button to the navigation bar:

```
// Register a custom button componentinstance.ui.registerComponent(  'convert.nav',  ({ builder: { Button }, engine }) => {    Button('conver-to-pdf', {      label: 'Convert To PDF',      icon: '@imgly/Download',      color: 'accent',      onClick: async () => {        // Export the current scene as a PDF blob        const scene = engine.scene.get();        const blob = await engine.block.export(scene, {          mimeType: 'application/pdf',        });        // Trigger download of the PDF blob        const element = document.createElement('a');        element.setAttribute('href', window.URL.createObjectURL(blob));        element.setAttribute('download', 'converted.pdf');        element.style.display = 'none';        element.click();        element.remove();      },    });  },);
// Add the custom button at the end of the navigation bareditor.ui.setNavigationBarOrder([  ...editor.ui.getNavigationBarOrder(),  'convert.nav',]);
```

For more details on customizing the UI, see the [User Interface Configuration Guide](nextjs/user-interface/customization-72b2f8/).

## Configuring PDF Output[#](#configuring-pdf-output)

The SDK provides various options for customizing PDF exports. You can control resolution, compatibility and underlayer.

### Available PDF Output Settings[#](#available-pdf-output-settings)

*   **Resolution:** Adjust the DPI (dots per inch) to create print-ready PDFs with the desired level of detail.
*   **Page Size:** Define custom dimensions in pixels for the output PDF. If specified, the block will scale to fully cover the target size while maintaining its aspect ratio.
*   **Compatibility:** Enable this setting to improve compatibility with various PDF viewers. When enabled, images and effects are rasterized based on the scene’s DPI instead of being embedded as vector elements.
*   **Underlayer:** Add an underlayer beneath the image content to optimize printing on non-white or specialty media (e.g., fabric, glass). The ink type is defined in `ExportOptions` using a spot color. You can also apply a positive or negative offset, in design units, to adjust the underlayer’s scale. See the guide Export for Printing to learn more.

### PDF Performance Optimization[#](#pdf-performance-optimization)

The `exportPdfWithHighCompatibility` flag significantly impacts PDF export performance, especially for high-DPI content:

**When `true` (default - safer but slower):**

*   Rasterizes images and gradients at the scene’s DPI setting
*   Maximum compatibility with all PDF viewers including Safari and macOS Preview
*   Slower performance (4-10x slower for high-DPI content)
*   Larger file sizes

**When `false` (faster but needs testing):**

*   Embeds images and gradients directly as native PDF objects
*   6-15x faster export performance for high-DPI content
*   Smaller file sizes (typically 30-40% reduction)
*   May have rendering issues in Safari/macOS Preview with gradients that use transparency

```
const scene = engine.scene.get();
// For maximum performance (test with your print workflow first)engine.block.setFloat(scene, 'scene/dpi', 150); // Reduce from default 300const blob = await engine.block.export(scene, {  mimeType: 'application/pdf',  exportPdfWithHighCompatibility: false, // Much faster});
```

**Before using `exportPdfWithHighCompatibility: false` in production:**

*   Test generated PDFs with your actual print vendor/equipment
*   Verify rendering in Safari and macOS Preview if end-users will view PDFs in those applications
*   Check that gradients with transparency render correctly
*   Confirm your content renders properly in Adobe Acrobat and Chrome (these typically work fine)

**Safe to use `false` when:**

*   PDFs go directly to professional printing (not viewed in Safari/Preview)
*   Content is primarily photos and solid colors (minimal gradients with transparency)
*   Performance is critical for batch processing workflows

**Keep `true` when:**

*   Users view PDFs in Safari or macOS Preview
*   Maximum compatibility is required
*   Content has complex gradients with transparency
*   You cannot test with your print workflow before production

### Customizing PDF Output[#](#customizing-pdf-output)

You can configure these settings when exporting:

```
const scene = engine.scene.get();
// Adjust the DPI to 72engine.block.setFloat(scene, 'scene/dpi', 72);
// Set spot color to be used as underlayerengine.editor.setSpotColorRGB('RDG_WHITE', 0.8, 0.8, 0.8);
const blob = await engine.block.export(scene, {  mimeType: 'application/pdf',  // Set target width and height in pixels  targetWidth: 800,  targetHeight: 600,  // Increase compatibility with different PDF viewers  exportPdfWithHighCompatibility: true,  // Add an underlayer beneath the image content  exportPdfWithUnderlayer: true,  underlayerSpotColorName: 'RDG_WHITE',  underlayerOffset: -2.0,});
```

  engine.block.appendChild(page, block);
  /* Zoom the scene's camera on our page. */  engine.scene.zoomToBlock(page);});
```

```
<!doctype html><html lang="en">  <head>    <meta charset="UTF-8" />    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />    <style>      body {        margin: 0;        overflow: hidden;      }      html {        overscroll-behavior-x: contain;      }    </style>  </head>
  <body>    <div id="cesdk_container" style="width: 100%; height: 100vh"></div>    <script type="module" src="index.js"></script>  </body></html>
```

Commonly, a scene contains several pages which in turn contain any other blocks such as images and texts. A block (or design block) is the main building unit in CE.SDK. Blocks are organized in a hierarchy through parent-child relationships. A scene is a specialized block that acts as the root of this hierarchy.

At any time, the engine holds only a single scene. Loading or creating a scene will replace the current one.

## Interacting With The Scene[#](#interacting-with-the-scene)

### Creating or Using an Existing Scene[#](#creating-or-using-an-existing-scene)

When using the Engine’s API in the context of the CE.SDK editor, there’s already an existing scene. You can obtain a handle to this scene by calling the [SceneAPI](nextjs/concepts/scenes-e8596d/)’s `scene.get(): number` method. However, when using the Engine on its own you first have to create a scene, e.g. using `scene.create(): number`. See the [Creating Scenes](nextjs/open-the-editor-23a1db/) guide for more details and options.

```
  let scene = engine.scene.get();  /* In engine only mode we have to create our own scene and page. */  if (!scene) {    scene = engine.scene.create();
```

Next, we need a page to place our blocks on. The scene automatically arranges its pages either in a vertical (the default) or horizontal layout. Again in the context of the editor, there’s already an existing page. To fetch that page call the [BlockAPI](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/)’s `block.findByType(type: ObjectType): number[]` method and use the first element of the returned array.

When only using the engine, you have to create a page yourself and append it to the scene. To do that create the page using `block.create(type: DesignBlockType): number` and append it to the scene with `block.appendChild(parent: number, child: number)`.

```
    const page = engine.block.create('page');    engine.block.appendChild(scene, page);  }  /* Find all pages in our scene. */  const pages = engine.block.findByType('page');  /* Use the first page we found. */  const page = pages[0];
```

At this point, you should have a handle to an existing scene as well as a handle to its page. Now it gets interesting when we start to add different types of blocks to the scene’s page.

### Modifying the Scene[#](#modifying-the-scene)

As an example, we create a graphic block using the [BlockAPI](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/)’s `create()` method which we already used for creating our page. Then we set a rect shape and an image fill to this newly created block to give it a visual representation. To see what other kinds of blocks are available see the [Block Types](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/) in the API Reference.

```
/* Create an graphic block with an image fill and add it to the scene's page. */const block = engine.block.create('graphic');engine.block.setShape(block, engine.block.createShape('rect'));const imageFill = engine.block.createFill('image');engine.block.setFill(block, imageFill);
```

We set a property of our newly created image fill by giving it a URL to reference an image file from. We also make sure the entire image stays visible by setting the block’s content fill mode to `'Contain'`. To learn more about block properties check out the [Block Properties](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/) API Reference.

```
engine.block.setString(  imageFill,  'fill/image/imageFileURI',  'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/imgly_logo.jpg',);/* The content fill mode 'Contain' ensures the entire image is visible. */engine.block.setEnum(block, 'contentFill/mode', 'Contain');
```

And finally, for our image to be visible we have to add it to our page using `appendChild`.

```
engine.block.appendChild(page, block);
```

To frame everything nicely and put it into view we direct the scene’s camera to zoom on our page.

```
/* Zoom the scene's camera on our page. */engine.scene.zoomToBlock(page);
```

const unsubscribe = engine.editor.onHistoryUpdated(() => {  const canUndo = engine.editor.canUndo();  const canRedo = engine.editor.canRedo();  console.log('History updated', { canUndo, canRedo });});
// Push a new state to the undo stackengine.editor.addUndoStep();
// Perform an undo, if possible.if (engine.editor.canUndo()) {  engine.editor.undo();}
// Perform a redo, if possible.if (engine.editor.canRedo()) {  engine.editor.redo();}
```

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to undo and redo steps in the `editor` API.

## Functions[#](#functions)

```
createHistory(): HistoryId
```

```

Get the handle to the currently active history. If there’s none it will be created.

*   Returns History - The handle of the active history.

```
addUndoStep(): void
```

Adds a new history state to the stack, if undoable changes were made.

```
undo(): void
```

Undo one step in the history if an undo step is available.

```
canUndo(): boolean
```

If an undo step is available.

*   Returns True if an undo step is available.

```
redo(): void
```

Redo one step in the history if a redo step is available.

```
canRedo(): boolean
```

If a redo step is available.

[Source](https:/img.ly/docs/cesdk/nextjs/concepts/resources-a58d71)

# Working With Resources

```
const scene = engine.scene.get();
// Forcing  all resources of all the blocks in a scene or the resources of graphic block to loadawait engine.block.forceLoadResources([scene]);
const graphics = engine.block.findByType('graphic');await engine.block.forceLoadResources(graphics);
```

By default, a scene’s resources are loaded on-demand. You can manually trigger the loading of all resources in a scene of for specific blocks by calling `forceLoadResources`. Any set of blocks can be passed as argument and whatever resources these blocks require will be loaded.

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to forcibly pre-load all resources contained in a scene.

```
forceLoadResources(ids: DesignBlockId[]): Promise<void>
```

Begins loading the resources of the given blocks and their children. If the resource had been loaded earlier and resulted in an error, it will be reloaded. This function is useful for preloading resources before they are needed. Warning: For elements with a source set, all elements in the source set will be loaded.

*   `ids`: The blocks whose resources should be loaded. The given blocks don’t require to have resources and can have children blocks (e.g. a scene block or a page block).
*   Returns A Promise that resolves once the resources have finished loading.

### Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here’s the full code:

```
const scene = engine.scene.get();
// Forcing  all resources of all the blocks in a scene or the resources of graphic block to loadawait engine.block.forceLoadResources([scene]);
const graphics = engine.block.findByType('graphic');await engine.block.forceLoadResources(graphics);

# Pages

Although the editor can manage a collection of pages with varying dimensions, our interfaces are presently designed to maintain a consistent dimension across all pages. Consequently, loading scenes with pages of different dimensions may lead to unexpected behavior, and the editor might adjust your scene accordingly.

```

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to subscribe to creation, update, and destruction events of design blocks.

## Subscribing to Events[#](#subscribing-to-events)

The event API provides a single function to subscribe to design block events. The types of events are:

*   `'Created'`: The design block was just created.
    
*   `'Updated'`: A property of the design block was updated.
    
*   `'Destroyed'`: The design block was destroyed. Note that a destroyed block will have become invalid and trying to use Block API functions on it will result in an exception. You can always use the Block API’s `isValid` function to verify whether a block is valid before use.
    

All events that occur during an engine update are batched, deduplicated, and always delivered at the very end of the engine update. Deduplication means you will receive at most one `'Updated'` event per block per subscription, even though there could potentially be multiple updates to a block during the engine update. To be clear, this also means the order of the event list provided to your event callback won’t reflect the actual order of events within an engine update.

*   `subscribe(blocks: number[], callback: (events: {type: string, block: number}[]) => void): () => void`  
    subscribe to events from a given list of blocks. Providing an empty list will subscribe to events from all of the engine’s blocks. The provided callback will receive a list of events that occurred in the last engine update. Each event consists of the event `type` and the affected `block`. The returned function shall be used to unsubscribe from receiving further events.

```
const unsubscribe = engine.event.subscribe([block], (events) => {  for (let i = 0; i < events.length; i++) {    const event = events[i];
```

## Unsubscribing from events[#](#unsubscribing-from-events)

*   `subscribe` returns a function that can be called to unsubscribe from receiving events.

Note that it is important to unsubscribe when done. At the end of each update the engine has to prepare a list of events for each individual subscriber. Unsubscribing will help to reduce unnecessary work and improve performance.

```
unsubscribe();
```

# Editing Workflow

## Roles[#](#roles)

User roles allow the CE.SDK to change and adapt its UI layout and functionality to provide the optimal editing experience for a specific purpose.

### Creator[#](#creator)

The `Creator` role is the most powerful and least restrictive role that is offered by the CE.SDK. Running the editor with this role means that there are no limits to what the user can do with the loaded scene.

Elements can be added, moved, deleted, and modified. All types of controls for modifying the selected elements are shown inside of the inspector.

### Adopter[#](#adopter)

The `Adopter` role allows new elements to be added and modified. Existing elements of a scene are only modifiable based on the set of constraints that the `Creator` has manually enabled.

This provides the `Adopter` with a simpler interface that is reduced to only the properties that they should be able to change and prevents them from accidentally changing or deleting parts of a design that should not be modified.

An example use case for how such a distinction between `Creator` and `Adopter` roles can provide a lot of value is the process of designing business cards.

A professional designer (using the `Creator` role) can create a template design of the business card with the company name, logo, colors, etc. They can then use the constraints to make only the name text editable for non-creators. Non-designers (either the employees themselves or the HR department) can then easily open the design in a CE.SDK instance with the `Adopter` role and are able to quickly change the name on the business card and export it for printing, without a designer having to get involved.

### Role customization[#](#role-customization)

Roles in the CE.SDK are sets of global scopes and settings. When changing the role via the `setRole` command in the EditorAPI, the internal defaults for that role are applied as described in the previous sections.

The CE.SDK and Engine provide a `onRoleChanged` callback subscription on the EditorAPI. Callbacks registered here are invoked whenever the role changes and can be used to configure additional settings or adjust the default scopes and settings.

```
instance.engine.editor.onRoleChanged(role => {  if (role === 'Adopter') {    // Enable the filter tab in the appearance panel when previewing the    // design in the Adopter role.    instance.engine.editor.setGlobalScope('appearance/filter', 'Allow');  }});
```

[Source](https:/img.ly/docs/cesdk/nextjs/concepts/edit-modes-1f5b6c)

# Editor State

```
const unsubscribeState = engine.editor.onStateChanged(() =>  console.log('Editor state has changed'),);
// Native modes: 'Transform', 'Crop', 'Text'engine.editor.setEditMode('Crop');engine.editor.getEditMode(); // 'Crop'
engine.editor.unstable_isInteractionHappening();
// Use this information to alter the displayed cursorengine.editor.getCursorType();engine.editor.getCursorRotation();
// Query information about the text cursor positionengine.editor.getTextCursorPositionInScreenSpaceX();engine.editor.getTextCursorPositionInScreenSpaceY();
```

The CreativeEditor SDK operates in different states called **Edit Modes**, each designed for a specific type of interaction on the canvas:

*   `Transform`: this is the default mode which allow to move, resize and manipulate things on the canvas
*   `Text`: Allows to edit the text elements on the canvas
*   `Crop`: Allow to Crop media blocks (images, videos, etc…)
*   `Trim`: Trim the clips in video mode
*   `Playback`: Play the media (mostly video) in video mode

While users typically interact with these modes through the UI (e.g., showing or hiding specific controls based on the active mode), it’s also possible to manage them programmatically via the engine’s API, though this isn’t always required.

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to set and query the editor state in the `editor` API, i.e., what type of content the user is currently able to edit.

## State[#](#state)

The editor state consists of the current edit mode, which informs what type of content the user is currently able to edit. The edit mode can be set to either `'Transform'`, `'Crop'`, `'Text'`, or a custom user-defined one. You can also query the intended mouse cursor and the location of the text cursor while editing text.

Instead of having to constantly query the state in a loop, you can also be notified when the state has changed to then act on these changes in a callback.

```
onStateChanged: (callback: () => void) => (() => void)
```

Subscribe to changes to the editor state.

*   `callback`: This function is called at the end of the engine update, if the editor state has changed.
*   Returns A method to unsubscribe.

```
setEditMode(mode: EditMode): void
```

Set the edit mode of the editor. An edit mode defines what type of content can currently be edited by the user. Hint: the initial edit mode is “Transform”.

*   `mode`: “Transform”, “Crop”, “Text”, “Playback”, “Trim” or a custom value.

```
getEditMode(): EditMode
```

Get the current edit mode of the editor. An edit mode defines what type of content can currently be edited by the user.

*   Returns “Transform”, “Crop”, “Text”, “Playback”, “Trim” or a custom value.

```
unstable_isInteractionHappening(): boolean
```

If an user interaction is happening, e.g., a resize edit with a drag handle or a touch gesture.

*   Returns True if an interaction is happening.

## Cursor[#](#cursor)

```
getCursorType(): 'Arrow' | 'Move' | 'MoveNotPermitted' | 'Resize' | 'Rotate' | 'Text'
```

Get the type of cursor that should be displayed by the application.

*   Returns The cursor type.

```
getCursorRotation(): number
```

Get the rotation with which to render the mouse cursor.

*   Returns The angle in radians.

```
getTextCursorPositionInScreenSpaceX(): number
```

Get the current text cursor’s x position in screen space.

*   Returns The text cursor’s x position in screen space.

```
getTextCursorPositionInScreenSpaceY(): number
```

Get the current text cursor’s y position in screen space.

*   Returns The text cursor’s y position in screen space.

## Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here’s the full code:

```
const unsubscribeState = engine.editor.onStateChanged(() =>  console.log('Editor state has changed'),);
// Native modes: 'Transform', 'Crop', 'Text'engine.editor.setEditMode('Crop');engine.editor.getEditMode(); // 'Crop'
engine.editor.unstable_isInteractionHappening();
// Use this information to alter the displayed cursorengine.editor.getCursorType();engine.editor.getCursorRotation();
// Query information about the text cursor positionengine.editor.getTextCursorPositionInScreenSpaceX();engine.editor.getTextCursorPositionInScreenSpaceY();
```

# Design Units

The CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) Engine supports three different design units for all layouting values. This includes element positions, sizes and bleed margins.

Supported design units are:

*   Pixels `px`
*   Millimeters `mm`
*   Inches `in`

## Font sizes[#](#font-sizes)

Unlike all other values, font sizes are always defined in points `pt`.

## DPI[#](#dpi)

If a scene uses a unit other than pixel `px`, the `dpi` property of that scene determines all conversions between the unit and pixels whenever necessary. Therefore, the `dpi` controls the export resolution of such a scenes blocks.

This `dpi` value is also used in order to convert all font sizes into the design unit of the current scene. If the `dpi` property is changed in a scene with pixel unit, all text block’s font sizes are automatically adjusted so that the text stays visually the same size.

[Source](https:/img.ly/docs/cesdk/nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e)

# Blocks

Blocks are the base building blocks for scenes and represent elements on the canvas. You’re able to create complex hierarchies of blocks by appending them as children to other blocks either directly or through groups.

By default, the following blocks are available:

*   Page: `//ly.img.ubq/page` or `page`
*   Graphic: `//ly.img.ubq/graphic` or `graphic`
*   Text: `//ly.img.ubq/text` or `text`
*   Audio: `//ly.img.ubq/audio` or `audio`
*   Cutout: `//ly.img.ubq/cutout` or `cutout`

## Lifecycle[#](#lifecycle)

Only blocks that are direct or indirect children of a `page` block are rendered. Scenes without any `page` child may not be properly displayed by the CE.SDK editor.

### Functions[#](#functions)

```
create(type: DesignBlockType): DesignBlockId
```

Create a new block, fails if type is unknown.

*   `type`: The type of the block that shall be created.
*   Returns The created blocks handle.

To create a scene, use [`scene.create`](nextjs/open-the-editor-23a1db/) instead.

```
saveToString(blocks: DesignBlockId[], allowedResourceSchemes?: string[]): Promise<string>
```

Saves the given blocks into a string. If given the root of a block hierarchy, e.g. a page with multiple children, the entire hierarchy is saved.

*   `blocks`: The blocks to save
*   Returns A promise that resolves to a string representing the blocks or an error.

```
saveToArchive(blocks: DesignBlockId[]): Promise<Blob>
```

Saves the given blocks and all of their referenced assets into an archive. The archive contains all assets that were accessible when this function was called. Blocks in the archived scene reference assets relative from to the location of the scene file. These references are resolved when loading such a scene via `loadSceneFromURL`.

*   `blocks`: The blocks to save
*   Returns A promise that resolves with a Blob on success or an error on failure.

```
loadFromString(content: string): Promise<DesignBlockId[]>
```

Loads existing blocks from the given string. The blocks are not attached by default and won’t be visible until attached to a page or the scene. The UUID of the loaded blocks is replaced with a new one.

*   `content`: A string representing the given blocks.
*   Returns A promise that resolves with a list of handles representing the found blocks or an error.

```
loadFromArchiveURL(url: string): Promise<DesignBlockId[]>
```

Loads existing blocks from the given URL. The blocks are not attached by default and won’t be visible until attached to a page or the scene. The UUID of the loaded blocks is replaced with a new one.

*   `url`: The URL to load the blocks from.
*   Returns A promise that resolves with a list of handles representing the found blocks or an error.

```
getType(id: DesignBlockId): ObjectTypeLonghand
```

Get the type of the given block, fails if the block is invalid.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns The blocks type.

```
setName(id: DesignBlockId, name: string): void
```

Update a block’s name.

*   `id`: The block to update.
*   `name`: The name to set.

```
getName(id: DesignBlockId): string
```

Get a block’s name.

*   `id`: The block to query.

```
getUUID(id: DesignBlockId): string
```

Get a block’s UUID.

*   `id`: The block to query.

```
duplicate(id: DesignBlockId): DesignBlockId
```

Duplicates a block including its children. Required scope: ‘lifecycle/duplicate’ If the block is parented to a track that is set always-on-bottom, the duplicate is inserted in the same track immediately after the block. Otherwise, the duplicate is moved up in the hierarchy.

*   `id`: The block to duplicate.
*   Returns The handle of the duplicate.

```
destroy(id: DesignBlockId): void
```

Destroys a block. Required scope: ‘lifecycle/destroy’

*   `id`: The block to destroy.

```
isValid(id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Check if a block is valid. A block becomes invalid once it has been destroyed.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns True, if the block is valid.

### Full Code[#](#full-code)

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to modify scenes through the `block` API.

```
// Create, save and load blocksconst block = engine.block.create('graphic');const savedBlocksString = await engine.block.saveToString([block]);const loadedBlocksString = await engine.block.loadFromString(savedBlocks);const savedBlocksArchive = await engine.block.saveToArchive([block]);const loadedBlocksArchive = await engine.block.loadFromArchiveURL('https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v1/ly.img.template/templates/cesdk_postcard_1_blocks.zip');
// Check a blocks typeconst blockType = engine.block.getType(block);
// Alter a blocks nameengine.block.setName(block, 'someName');const name = engine.block.getName(block);const uuid = engine.block.getUUID(block);\
// You may duplicate or destroy blocksconst duplicate = engine.block.duplicate(block);engine.block.destroy(duplicate);engine.block.isValid(duplicate); // false
```

## Properties[#](#properties)

### UUID[#](#uuid)

A universally unique identifier (UUID) is assigned to each block upon creation and can be queried. This is stable across save & load and may be used to reference blocks.

```
getUUID(id: DesignBlockId): string
```

Get a block’s UUID.

*   `id`: The block to query.

### Reflection[#](#reflection)

For every block, you can get a list of all its properties by calling `findAllProperties(id: number): string[]`. Properties specific to a block are prefixed with the block’s type followed by a forward slash. There are also common properties shared between blocks which are prefixed by their respective type. A list of all properties can be found in the [Blocks Overview](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/).

```
findAllProperties(id: DesignBlockId): string[]
```

Get all available properties of a block.

*   `id`: The block whose properties should be queried.
*   Returns A list of the property names.

Given a property, you can query its type as an enum using `getPropertyType(property: string): 'Bool' | 'Int' | 'Float' | 'String' | 'Color' | 'Enum' | 'Struct'`.

```
getPropertyType(property: string): PropertyType
```

Get the type of a property given its name.

*   `property`: The name of the property whose type should be queried.
*   Returns The property type.

The property type `'Enum'` is a special type. Properties of this type only accept a set of certain strings. To get a list of possible values for an enum property call `getEnumValues(enumProperty: string): string[]`.

```
getEnumValues<T = string>(enumProperty: string): T[]
```

Get all the possible values of an enum given an enum property.

*   `enumProperty`: The name of the property whose enum values should be queried.
*   Returns A list of the enum value names as string.

Some properties can only be written to or only be read. To find out what is possible with a property, you can use the `isPropertyReadable` and `isPropertyWritable` methods.

```
isPropertyReadable(property: string): boolean
```

Check if a property with a given name is readable

*   `property`: The name of the property whose type should be queried.
*   Returns Whether the property is readable or not. Will return false for unknown properties

```
isPropertyWritable(property: string): boolean
```

Check if a property with a given name is writable

*   `property`: The name of the property whose type should be queried.
*   Returns Whether the property is writable or not. Will return false for unknown properties

### Generic Properties[#](#generic-properties)

There are dedicated setter and getter functions for each property type. You have to provide a block and the property path. Use `findAllProperties` to get a list of all the available properties a block has.

Please make sure you call the setter and getter function matching the type of the property you want to set or query or else you will get an error. Use `getPropertyType` to figure out the pair of functions you need to use.

```
findAllProperties(id: DesignBlockId): string[]
```

Get all available properties of a block.

*   `id`: The block to update.
*   `property`: The name of the property to modify.
*   `uri`: The source to add to the source set.

### Modifying Properties[#](#modifying-properties)

### Kind Property[#](#kind-property)

The `kind` of a design block is a custom string that can be assigned to a block in order to categorize it and distinguish it from other blocks that have the same type. The user interface can then customize its appearance based on the kind of the selected blocks. It can also be used for automation use cases in order to process blocks in a different way based on their kind.

```
setKind(id: DesignBlockId, kind: string): void
```

Set the kind of the given block, fails if the block is invalid.

*   `id`: The block whose kind should be changed.
*   `kind`: The new kind.
*   Returns The block’s kind.

```
getKind(id: DesignBlockId): string
```

Get the kind of the given block, fails if the block is invalid.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns The block’s kind.

```
findByKind(kind: string): DesignBlockId[]
```

Finds all blocks with the given kind.

*   `kind`: The kind to search for.
*   Returns A list of block ids.

#### Full Code[#](#full-code-1)

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to modify a and query the kind property of design blocks through the `block` API.

```
engine.block.setKind(text, 'title');const kind = engine.block.getKind(text);const allTitles = engine.block.findByKind('title');
```

## Selection & Visibility[#](#selection--visibility)

A block can potentially be _invisible_ (in the sense that you can’t see it), even though `isVisible()` returns true. This could be the case when a block has not been added to a parent, the parent itself is not visible, or the block is obscured by another block on top of it.

### Select blocks and change their visibility[#](#select-blocks-and-change-their-visibility)

### Full Code[#](#full-code-2)

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to modify scenes through the `block` API.

```
engine.block.setSelected(block, true);const isSelected = engine.block.isSelected(block);engine.block.select(block);const selectedIds = engine.block.findAllSelected();const unsubscribeSelectionChanged = engine.block.onSelectionChanged(() => {  const selectedIds = engine.block.findAllSelected();  console.log('Selection changed: ', selectedIds);});const unsubscribeOnClicked = engine.block.onClicked(block => {  console.log('Block clicked: ', block);});const isVisible = engine.block.isVisible(block);engine.block.setVisible(block, true);
const isClipped = engine.block.isClipped(page);engine.block.setClipped(page, true);
const isIncludedInExport = engine.block.isIncludedInExport(block);engine.block.setIncludedInExport(block, true);
```

## State[#](#state)

Blocks can perform operations that take some time or that can end in bad results. When that happens, blocks put themselves in a pending state or an error state and visual feedback is shown pertaining to the state. When an external operation is done to blocks, for example with a plugin, you may want to manually set the block’s state to pending (if that external operation takes time) or to error (if that operation resulted in an error).

The possible states of a block are:

```
BlockStateReady {    type: 'Ready';};
BlockStatePending {    type: 'Pending';    progress: number; // Expected range is [0, 1]}
BlockStateError {  type: 'Error';  error:    | 'AudioDecoding' // Failed to decode the block's audio stream.    | 'ImageDecoding' // Failed to decode the block's image stream.    | 'FileFetch' // Failed to retrieve the block's remote content.    | 'Unknown' // An unknown error occurred.    | 'VideoDecoding'; // Failed to decode the block's video stream.}
```

When calling `getState`, the returned state reflects the combined state of a block, the block’s fill, the block’s shape and the block’s effects. If any of these blocks is in an `Error` state, the returned state will reflect that error. If none of these blocks is in error state but any is in `Pending` state, the returned state will reflect the aggregate progress of the block’s progress. If none of the blocks are in error state or pending state, the returned state is `Ready`.

```
getState(id: DesignBlockId): BlockState
```

Returns the block’s state. If this block is in error state or this block has a `Shape` block, `Fill` block or `Effect` block(s), that is in error state, the returned state will be `Error`. Else, if this block is in pending state or this block has a `Shape` block, `Fill` block or `Effect` block(s), that is in pending state, the returned state will be `Pending`. Else, the returned state will be `Ready`.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns The block’s state.

```
setState(id: DesignBlockId, state: BlockState): void
```

Set the state of a block.

*   `id`: The block whose state should be set.
*   `state`: The new state to set.

```
onStateChanged: (ids: DesignBlockId[], callback: (ids: DesignBlockId[]) => void) => (() => void)
```

Subscribe to changes to the state of a block. Like `getState`, the state of a block is determined by the state of itself and its `Shape`, `Fill` and `Effect` block(s).

*   `blocks`: A list of blocks to filter events by. If the list is empty, events for every block are sent.
*   `callback`: The event callback.
*   Returns Subscription A handle to the subscription. Use it to unsubscribe when done.

### Full Code[#](#full-code-3)

In this example, we will show you how to use [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to retrieve’s a block’s state and to manually set a block in a pending state, an error state or back to a ready state.

```
const subscription = engine.block.onStateChanged([], blocks => {  blocks.forEach(block => console.log(block));});const state = engine.block.getState(block);engine.block.setState(block, { type: 'Pending', progress: 0.5 });engine.block.setState(block, { type: 'Ready' });engine.block.setState(block, { type: 'Error', error: 'ImageDecoding' });
```

In this example, we will show you how to configure the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk). CE.SDK has full support for custom color libraries. These appear in the color picker, and allow users to choose from pre-defined sets of colors to use in their design. They can include RGB colors, CMYK colors, and spot colors. They can be used to support your users with a variety of palettes, brand colors, or color books for printing. Note that many providers of color books (e.g. Pantone) require a license to use their data.

## General Concept[#](#general-concept)

Color libraries are implemented as asset sources, containing individual colors as assets. Each color library is identified by a source ID, a unique string used when establishing and configuring the source.

## Defining Colors[#](#defining-colors)

To integrate colors into a library, we need to supply them in the shape of an `AssetDefinition`. For more details on the `AssetDefinition` type, please consult our Guide on [integrating custom asset sources](nextjs/import-media/from-remote-source/unsplash-8f31f0/).

For colors, we are utilizing the `payload` key, providing an `AssetColor` to the `AssetPayload.color` property. In this example, we define one color for every type; see below for the applicable types:

### `AssetRGBColor`[#](#assetrgbcolor)

| Member | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| colorSpace | `'sRGB'` |  |
| r, g, b, a | `number` | Red, green, blue, and alpha color channel components |

### `AssetCMYKColor`[#](#assetcmykcolor)

| Member | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| colorSpace | `'CMYK'` |  |
| c, m, y, k | `number` | Cyan, magenta, yellow, and black color channel components |

### `AssetSpotColor`[#](#assetspotcolor)

| Member | Type | Description | | ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | colorSpace | `'SpotColor'` | | | name | `string` | Unique identifier of this spot color. Make sure this matches the standardized name of the spot color when using color books like those supplied by Pantone. | | externalReference | `string` | Reference to the source of this spot color (e.g. name of color book), if applicable. | | representation | `AssetRGBColor` | `AssetCMYKColor` | Note that spot colors also require a CMYK or RGB color representation, which is used to display an approximate color on screen during editing. |

In this example, we are defining one of each color type, and add them to a single library, for demonstration purposes. Although there is no technical requirement to do so, it is recommended to separate different color types (RGB, CMYK, Spot) into separate libraries, to avoid confusing users.

```
const colors = [  {    id: 'RGB Murky Magenta',    label: { en: 'RGB Murky Magenta' },    tags: { en: ['RGB', 'Murky', 'Magenta'] },    payload: {      color: {        colorSpace: 'sRGB',        r: 0.65,        g: 0.3,        b: 0.65,        a: 1      }    }  },  {    id: 'Spot Goo Green',    label: { en: 'Spot Goo Green' },    tags: { en: ['Spot', 'Goo', 'Green'] },    payload: {      color: {        colorSpace: 'SpotColor',        name: 'Spot Goo Green',        externalReference: 'My Spot Color Book',        representation: {          colorSpace: 'sRGB',          r: 0.7,          g: 0.98,          b: 0.13,          a: 1        }      }    }  },  {    id: 'CMYK Baby Blue',    label: { en: 'CMYK Baby Blue' },    tags: { en: ['CMYK', 'Baby', 'Blue'] },    payload: {      color: {        colorSpace: 'CMYK',        c: 0.5,        m: 0,        y: 0,        k: 0      }    }  }];
```

## Configuration[#](#configuration)

### Labels[#](#labels)

To show the correct labels for your color library, provide a matching i18n key in your configuration. Color libraries use keys in the format `libraries.<your-library-source-id>.label` to look up the correct label.

```
  cesdk.i18n.setTranslations({    en: {      'libraries.myCustomColors.label': 'Custom Color Library'    }  });
```

### Order[#](#order)

Color libraries appear in the color picker in a specific order. To define this order, use `cesdk.ui.updateAssetLibraryEntry('ly.img.colors', { sourceIds: [...] })` after initialization. The special source `'ly.img.colors.defaultPalette'` is used to place the default palette (See: [Configuring the Default Color Palette](nextjs/user-interface/customization/color-palette-429fd9/)). If you want to hide this default palette, just remove it from the array.

```
// Update color library entry with custom source IDscesdk.ui.updateAssetLibraryEntry('ly.img.colors', {  sourceIds: ['ly.img.colors.defaultPalette', 'myCustomColors']});
```

## Adding the library[#](#adding-the-library)

After initializing the engine, use the Asset API to add a local asset source using `addLocalSource`. Afterwards, add colors to the new source using `addAssetToSource`. Make sure to use the same source ID as is referenced in the configuration. See also [Local Asset Sources](nextjs/import-media/from-remote-source/unsplash-8f31f0/) in our Guide on [integrating custom asset sources](nextjs/import-media/from-remote-source/unsplash-8f31f0/)

```
cesdk.engine.asset.addLocalSource('myCustomColors', ['text/plain']);for (const asset of colors) {  cesdk.engine.asset.addAssetToSource('myCustomColors', asset);}
```

Here’s the full code:

```

# Color Conversion

To ease implementing advanced color interfaces, you may rely on the engine to perform color conversions.

Converts a color to the given color space.

*   `color`: The color to convert.
*   `colorSpace`: The color space to convert to.
*   Returns The converted color.

```
// Convert a colorconst color = engine.block.getStrokeColor(block);const cmykColor = engine.editor.convertColorToColorSpace(color, 'CMYK');
```

[Source](https:/img.ly/docs/cesdk/nextjs/colors/basics-307115)

# Basics

When specifying a color property, you can use one of three color spaces: [RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model), [CMYK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model) and [spot color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_color).

During export, only RGB and spot color values will be inserted into the resulting PDF. Any color specified in CMYK values will be converted to RGB using the standard conversion. Tint values will be retained in the alpha channel.

The following properties can be set with the function `setColor` and support all three color spaces:

*   `'backgroundColor/color'`
*   `'camera/clearColor'`
*   `'dropShadow/color'`
*   `'fill/color/value'`
*   `'stroke/color'`

## RGB[#](#rgb)

RGB is the color space used when rendering a color to a screen. All values of `R`, `G`, `B`must be between `0.0` and `1.0`

When using RGB, you typically also specify opacity or alpha as a value between `0.0` and `1.0` and is then referred to as `RGBA`. When a RGB color has an alpha value that is not `1.0`, it will be rendered to screen with corresponding transparency.

## CMYK[#](#cmyk)

CMYK is the color space used when color printing. All values of `C`, `M`, `Y`, and `K` must be between `0.0` and `1.0`

When using CMYK, you can also specify a tint value between `0.0` and `1.0`. When a CMYK color has a tint value that is not `1.0`, it will be rendered to screen as if transparent over a white background.

When rendering to screen, CMYK colors are first converted to RGB using a simple mathematical conversion. Currently, the same conversion happens when exporting a scene to a PDF file.

## Spot Color[#](#spot-color)

Spot colors are typically used for special printers or other devices that understand how to use them. Spot colors are defined primarily by their name as that is the information that the device will use to render.

For the purpose of rendering a spot color to screen, it must be given either an RGB or CMYK color approximation or both. These approximations adhere to the same restrictions respectively described above. You can specify a tint as a value between `0.0` and `1.0` which will be interpreted as opacity when rendering to screen. It is up to the special printer or device how to interpret the tint value. You can also specify an external reference, a string describing the origin of this spot color.

When rendering to screen, the spot color’s RGB or CMYK approximation will be used, in that order of preference. When exporting a scene to a PDF file, spot colors will be saved as a [Separation Color Space](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/pdfstandards/pdfreference1.6.pdf#G9.1850648).

Using a spot color is a two step process:

1.  you define a spot color with its name and color approximation(s) in the spot color registry.
2.  you instantiate a spot color with its name, a tint and an external reference.

The spot color registry allows you to:

*   list the defined spot colors
*   define a new a spot color with a name and its RGB or CMYK approximation
*   re-define an existing spot color’s RGB or CMYK approximation
*   retrieve the RGB or CMYK approximation of an already defined spot color
*   remove a spot color from the list of defined spot colors

Multiple blocks and their properties can refer to the same spot color and each can have a different tint and external reference.

**Warning** If a block’s color property refers to an undefined spot color, the default color magenta with an RGB approximation of (1, 0, 1) will be used.

## Converting between colors[#](#converting-between-colors)

A utility function `convertColorToColorSpace` is provided to create a new color from an existing color and a new color space. RGB and CMYK colors can be converted between each other and is done so using a simple mathematical conversion. Spot colors can be converted to RGB and CMYK simply by using the corresponding approximation. RGB and CMYK colors cannot be converted to spot colors.

## Custom Color Libraries[#](#custom-color-libraries)

You can configure CE.SDK with custom color libraries. More information is found [here](nextjs/colors/create-color-palette-7012e0/).

  engine.block.setColor(fill, `fill/color/value`, rgbaBlue);  engine.block.setColor(fill, `fill/color/value`, cmykRed);  engine.block.setColor(block, `stroke/color`, cmykPartialRed);  engine.block.setColor(fill, `fill/color/value`, spotPinkFlamingo);  engine.block.setColor(block, `dropShadow/color`, spotPartialYellow);
  const cmykBlueConverted = engine.editor.convertColorToColorSpace(    rgbaBlue,    'CMYK'  );  const rgbaPinkFlamingoConverted = engine.editor.convertColorToColorSpace(    spotPinkFlamingo,    'sRGB'  );
  engine.editor.findAllSpotColors(); // ['Crayola-Pink-Flamingo', 'Yellow']
  engine.editor.setSpotColorCMYK('Yellow', 0.2, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
  engine.editor.removeSpotColor('Yellow');});
```

## Setup the scene[#](#setup-the-scene)

We first create a new scene with a graphic block that has a color fill.

```
  document.getElementById('cesdk_container').append(engine.element);
  const scene = engine.scene.create();
  const page = engine.block.create('page');  engine.block.setWidth(page, 800);  engine.block.setHeight(page, 600);  engine.block.appendChild(scene, page);
  engine.scene.zoomToBlock(page, 40, 40, 40, 40);
  const block = engine.block.create('graphic');  engine.block.setShape(block, engine.block.createShape('rect'));  engine.block.setFill(block, engine.block.createFill('color'));  engine.block.setPositionX(block, 350);  engine.block.setPositionY(block, 400);  engine.block.setWidth(block, 100);  engine.block.setHeight(block, 100);
  const fill = engine.block.getFill(block);
```

## Create colors[#](#create-colors)

Here we instantiate a few colors with RGB and CMYK color spaces. We also define two spot colors, one with an RGB approximation and another with a CMYK approximation. Note that a spot colors can have both color space approximations.

```
  const rgbaBlue = { r: 0.0, g: 0.0, b: 1.0, a: 1.0 };  const cmykRed = { c: 0.0, m: 1.0, y: 1.0, k: 0.0, tint: 1.0 };  const cmykPartialRed = { c: 0.0, m: 1.0, y: 1.0, k: 0.0, tint: 0.5 };
  engine.editor.setSpotColorRGB('Pink-Flamingo', 0.988, 0.455, 0.992);  engine.editor.setSpotColorCMYK('Yellow', 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);  const spotPinkFlamingo = {    name: 'Pink-Flamingo',    tint: 1.0,    externalReference: 'Crayola'  };  const spotPartialYellow = {    name: 'Yellow',    tint: 0.3,    externalReference: ''  };
```

## Applying colors to a block[#](#applying-colors-to-a-block)

We can use the defined colors to modify certain properties of a fill or properties of a block. Here we apply it to `'fill/color/value'`, `'stroke/color'` and `'dropShadow/color'`.

```
engine.block.setColor(fill, `fill/color/value`, rgbaBlue);engine.block.setColor(fill, `fill/color/value`, cmykRed);engine.block.setColor(block, `stroke/color`, cmykPartialRed);engine.block.setColor(fill, `fill/color/value`, spotPinkFlamingo);engine.block.setColor(block, `dropShadow/color`, spotPartialYellow);
```

## Converting colors[#](#converting-colors)

Using the utility function `convertColorToColorSpace` we create a new color in the CMYK color space by converting the `rgbaBlue` color to the CMYK color space. We also create a new color in the RGB color space by converting the `spotPinkFlamingo` color to the RGB color space.

```
const cmykBlueConverted = engine.editor.convertColorToColorSpace(  rgbaBlue,  'CMYK');const rgbaPinkFlamingoConverted = engine.editor.convertColorToColorSpace(  spotPinkFlamingo,  'sRGB');
```

## Listing spot colors[#](#listing-spot-colors)

This function returns the list of currently defined spot colors.

```
engine.editor.findAllSpotColors(); // ['Crayola-Pink-Flamingo', 'Yellow']
```

## Redefine a spot color[#](#redefine-a-spot-color)

We can re-define the RGB and CMYK approximations of an already defined spot color. Doing so will change the rendered color of the blocks. We change it for the CMYK approximation of `'Yellow'` and make it a bit greenish. The properties that have `'Yellow'` as their spot color will change when re-rendered.

```
engine.editor.setSpotColorCMYK('Yellow', 0.2, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
```

## Removing the definition of a spot color[#](#removing-the-definition-of-a-spot-color)

We can undefine a spot color. Doing so will make all the properties still referring to that spot color (`'Yellow'` in this case) use the default magenta RGB approximation.

```
engine.editor.removeSpotColor('Yellow');
```

  const cmykBlueConverted = engine.editor.convertColorToColorSpace(    rgbaBlue,    'CMYK',  );  const rgbaPinkFlamingoConverted = engine.editor.convertColorToColorSpace(    spotPinkFlamingo,    'sRGB',  );
  engine.editor.findAllSpotColors(); // ['Crayola-Pink-Flamingo', 'Yellow']
  engine.editor.setSpotColorCMYK('Yellow', 0.2, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
  engine.editor.removeSpotColor('Yellow');});
```

# Automate Design Generation

Automating design generation simplifies workflows and allows you to create dynamic, personalized designs at scale. By combining design templates with external data or user-provided input, you can quickly generate professional outputs for various use cases, from banner ads to direct mail.

With IMG.LY, you can use templates to define dynamic elements such as text, images, or other assets. These elements are populated with real-time data or user inputs during the generation process. This guide will walk you through the process of using the CE.SDK for programmatic design generation.

[

Launch Web Demo

](https://img.ly/showcases/cesdk/headless-design/web)

## Populating a Template[#](#populating-a-template)

A design template is a pre-configured layout that includes placeholders for dynamic elements such as text, images, or other assets. These placeholders define where and how specific content will appear in the final design. During the generation process, the placeholders are replaced with actual data to create a completed output.

*   **Creating or Editing Templates:** Design templates can be created or edited directly within the CE.SDK using our UI or programmatically. Learn more in the [Create Templates guide](nextjs/create-templates-3aef79/).
*   **Dynamic Content Sources:** Templates can be populated with data from various sources, such as:
    *   **JSON files:** Useful for batch operations where data is pre-prepared.
    *   **External APIs:** Ideal for real-time updates and dynamic integrations.
    *   **User Input:** Data provided directly by the user through a UI.

For detailed information on using and managing templates, see [Use Templates](nextjs/use-templates-a88fd4/).

Below is a diagram illustrating how data is merged into a template to produce a final design:

![Template data merge process diagram showing how variables and assets flow into the final output](/docs/cesdk/_astro/schema.excalidraw.CEnF4vNU_GsqTX.svg)

## Example Workflow[#](#example-workflow)

### 1\. Prepare the Template[#](#1-prepare-the-template)

Start by designing a template with text variables. Here’s an example postcard template with placeholders for the recipient’s details:

![Example postcard template with highlighted variable placeholders for name and address](/docs/cesdk/_astro/scene-example-backside.DrVrBaSF_ZWnyVB.webp)

### 2\. Load the Template into the Editor[#](#2-load-the-template-into-the-editor)

Initialize the CE.SDK and load your prepared template:

```
// Load a template from your server or a CDNconst sceneUrl =  'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v2/ly.img.template/templates/cesdk_postcard_2.scene';await engine.scene.loadFromURL(sceneUrl);
```

### 3\. Provide Data to Populate the Template[#](#3-provide-data-to-populate-the-template)

Populate your template with data from your chosen source:

```
// Option 1: Prepare your data as a javascript objectconst data = {  textVariables: {    first_name: 'John',    last_name: 'Doe',    address: '123 Main St.',    city: 'Anytown',  },};// Option 2: Fetch from an API// const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/design-data').then(res => res.json());engine.variable.setString('first_name', data.textVariables.first_name);engine.variable.setString('last_name', data.textVariables.last_name);engine.variable.setString('address', data.textVariables.address);engine.variable.setString('city', data.textVariables.city);
```

### 4\. Export the Final Design[#](#4-export-the-final-design)

Once the template is populated, export the final design in your preferred format:

```
const output = await engine.block.export(engine.scene.get(), {  mimeType: 'application/pdf',});// Success: 'output' contains your generated design as a PDF Blob// You can now save it or display it in your application
```

Here’s what your final output should look like:

![Exported postcard design showing populated name and address fields](/docs/cesdk/_astro/scene-example-backside-export.CaGuyU7v_1hqBcg.webp)

Need help with exports? Check out the [Export Guide](nextjs/export-save-publish/export-82f968/) for detailed instructions and options.

## Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting)

If you encounter issues during the generation process:

*   Verify that all your variable names exactly match those in your template
*   Ensure your template is accessible from the provided URL
*   Check that your data values are in the correct format (strings for text variables)
*   Monitor the console for detailed error messages from the CE.SDK

# Supported Animation Types

## Animation Categories[#](#animation-categories)

There are three different categories of animations: _In_, _Out_ and _Loop_ animations.

### In Animations[#](#in-animations)

_In_ animations animate a block for a specified duration after the block first appears in the scene. For example, if a block has a time offset of 4s in the scene and it has an _In_ animation with a duration of 1s, then the appearance of the block will be animated between 4s and 5s with the _In_ animation.

### Out Animations[#](#out-animations)

_Out_ animations animate a block for a specified duration before the block disappears from the scene. For example, if a block has a time offset of 4s in the scene and a duration of 5s and it has an _Out_ animation with a duration of 1s, then the appearance of the block will be animated between 8s and 9s with the _Out_ animation.

### Loop Animations[#](#loop-animations)

_Loop_ animations animate a block for the total duration that the block is visible in the scene. _Loop_ animations also run simultaneously with _In_ and _Out_ animations, if those are present.

## Animation Presets[#](#animation-presets)

We currently support the following _In_ and _Out_ animation presets:

*   `'//ly.img.ubq/animation/slide'`
*   `'//ly.img.ubq/animation/pan'`

Gradient fills are one of the fundamental fill types in CE.SDK, allowing you to paint design blocks with smooth color transitions. Unlike solid color fills that apply a uniform color or image fills that display photo content, gradient fills create dynamic visual effects with depth and visual interest. The gradient fill system supports three types: linear gradients that transition along a straight line, radial gradients that emanate from a center point, and conical gradients that rotate around a center point like a color wheel.

## Understanding Gradient Fills[#](#understanding-gradient-fills)

### What is a Gradient Fill?[#](#what-is-a-gradient-fill)

A gradient fill is a fill object that paints a design block with smooth color transitions. Gradient fills are part of the broader fill system in CE.SDK and come in three types, each identified by a unique type string:

*   **Linear**: `'//ly.img.ubq/fill/gradient/linear'` or `'gradient/linear'`
*   **Radial**: `'//ly.img.ubq/fill/gradient/radial'` or `'gradient/radial'`
*   **Conical**: `'//ly.img.ubq/fill/gradient/conical'` or `'gradient/conical'`

Each gradient type contains color stops that define colors at specific positions and positioning properties that control the gradient’s direction and coverage.

### Gradient Types Comparison[#](#gradient-types-comparison)

#### Linear Gradients[#](#linear-gradients)

Linear gradients transition colors along a straight line defined by start and end points. They’re the most common gradient type and create clean, modern looks. Common use cases include hero sections, call-to-action buttons, headers, and banners.

    engine.block.setGradientColorStops(linearVertical, 'fill/gradient/colors', [      { color: { r: 1.0, g: 0.8, b: 0.2, a: 1.0 }, stop: 0 },      { color: { r: 0.3, g: 0.4, b: 0.7, a: 1.0 }, stop: 1 }    ]);
```

#### Radial Gradients[#](#radial-gradients)

Radial gradients emanate from a central point outward, creating circular or elliptical color transitions. They add depth and create focal points or spotlight effects. Common use cases include button highlights, card shadows, vignettes, and circular badges.

```
engine.block.setGradientColorStops(radialCentered, 'fill/gradient/colors', [  { color: { r: 1.0, g: 1.0, b: 1.0, a: 0.3 }, stop: 0 },  { color: { r: 0.2, g: 0.4, b: 0.8, a: 1.0 }, stop: 1 }]);
```

#### Conical Gradients[#](#conical-gradients)

Conical gradients transition colors around a center point like a color wheel, starting at the top (12 o’clock) and rotating clockwise. Colors are specified by position rather than angle. Common use cases include pie charts, loading spinners, circular progress indicators, and color picker wheels.

```
engine.block.setGradientColorStops(  conicalColorWheel,  'fill/gradient/colors',  [    { color: { r: 1.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 1 }, stop: 0 },    { color: { r: 1.0, g: 1.0, b: 0.0, a: 1 }, stop: 0.25 },    { color: { r: 0.0, g: 1.0, b: 0.0, a: 1 }, stop: 0.5 },    { color: { r: 0.0, g: 0.0, b: 1.0, a: 1 }, stop: 0.75 },    { color: { r: 1.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 1 }, stop: 1 }  ]);
```

### Gradient vs Other Fill Types[#](#gradient-vs-other-fill-types)

Understanding how gradients differ from other fill types helps you choose the right fill for your design:

*   **Gradient fills**: Smooth color transitions (linear, radial, conical)
*   **Color fills**: Solid, uniform color
*   **Image fills**: Photo or raster content
*   **Video fills**: Animated video content

### Color Stops Explained[#](#color-stops-explained)

Color stops define the colors at specific positions in the gradient. Each stop consists of:

*   `color`: An RGB, CMYK, or Spot color value
*   `stop`: Position value between 0.0 and 1.0 (0% to 100%)

A gradient requires a minimum of two color stops. You can add multiple stops to create complex color transitions. Color stops can use any color space supported by CE.SDK, including RGB for screen display, CMYK for print, and Spot Colors for brand consistency.

```
engine.block.setGradientColorStops(auroraGradient, 'fill/gradient/colors', [  { color: { r: 0.4, g: 0.1, b: 0.8, a: 1 }, stop: 0 },  { color: { r: 0.8, g: 0.2, b: 0.6, a: 1 }, stop: 0.3 },  { color: { r: 1.0, g: 0.5, b: 0.3, a: 1 }, stop: 0.6 },  { color: { r: 1.0, g: 0.8, b: 0.2, a: 1 }, stop: 1 }]);
```

## Using the Built-in Gradient UI[#](#using-the-built-in-gradient-ui)

CE.SDK provides built-in UI controls for working with gradients through the **inspector bar** and **advanced inspector**. Users can switch between solid color and gradient fills, select gradient type (linear, radial, conical), add and remove color stops visually, adjust individual stop colors, and drag gradient control points for positioning.

**Note**: Currently, only **linear gradients** are fully supported in the built-in UI. Radial and conical gradients are available programmatically.

### Enabling Fill Features[#](#enabling-fill-features)

Gradient controls are part of the fill feature system. You can check if the fill feature is enabled and control it programmatically:

```
// Fill features are enabled by default in CE.SDK// You can check and control fill feature availability:const engine = cesdk.engine;const isFillEnabled = cesdk.feature.isEnabled('ly.img.fill', { engine });console.log('Fill feature enabled:', isFillEnabled);
```

## Checking Gradient Fill Support[#](#checking-gradient-fill-support)

### Verifying Block Compatibility[#](#verifying-block-compatibility)

Before applying gradient fills, verify that the block type supports fills. Not all blocks support fills—for example, scenes and pages typically don’t.

```
// Check if block supports fillsconst canHaveFill = engine.block.supportsFill(block);if (!canHaveFill) {  throw new Error('Block does not support fills');}
```

Always check `supportsFill()` before accessing fill APIs. Graphic blocks, shapes, and text typically support fills.

## Creating Gradient Fills[#](#creating-gradient-fills)

### Creating a New Linear Gradient[#](#creating-a-new-linear-gradient)

Create a new linear gradient fill using the `createFill()` method with the type `'gradient/linear'`:

```
const { block: linearVerticalBlock, fill: linearVertical } =  createShapeWithFill('gradient/linear');
```

### Creating a Radial Gradient[#](#creating-a-radial-gradient)

Create a radial gradient using the type `'gradient/radial'`:

```
const { block: radialCenteredBlock, fill: radialCentered } =  createShapeWithFill('gradient/radial');
```

### Creating a Conical Gradient[#](#creating-a-conical-gradient)

Create a conical gradient using the type `'gradient/conical'`:

```
const { block: conicalColorWheelBlock, fill: conicalColorWheel } =  createShapeWithFill('gradient/conical');
```

The `createFill()` method returns a numeric fill ID. The fill exists independently until you attach it to a block. If you create a fill but don’t attach it to a block, you must destroy it manually to prevent memory leaks.

## Applying Gradient Fills[#](#applying-gradient-fills)

### Setting a Gradient Fill on a Block[#](#setting-a-gradient-fill-on-a-block)

Once you’ve created a gradient fill, attach it to a block using `setFill()`:

```
      // Create gradient fill      const gradientFill = engine.block.createFill(fillType);
      // Apply the fill to the block      engine.block.setFill(block, gradientFill);
```

### Getting the Current Fill[#](#getting-the-current-fill)

Retrieve the current fill attached to a block and inspect its type:

```
    const { block: inspectGradientBlock, fill: inspectGradient } =      createShapeWithFill('gradient/linear');
    engine.block.setGradientColorStops(      inspectGradient,      'fill/gradient/colors',      [        { color: { r: 0.6, g: 0.3, b: 0.7, a: 1.0 }, stop: 0 },        { color: { r: 0.3, g: 0.7, b: 0.6, a: 1.0 }, stop: 1 }      ]    );
    // Get current fill from block    const fillId = engine.block.getFill(block1);    const fillType = engine.block.getType(fillId);    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log('Fill type:', fillType); // '//ly.img.ubq/fill/gradient/linear'
```

## Configuring Gradient Color Stops[#](#configuring-gradient-color-stops)

### Setting Color Stops[#](#setting-color-stops)

Set color stops using the `setGradientColorStops()` method with an array of color and position pairs:

```
engine.block.setGradientColorStops(linearVertical, 'fill/gradient/colors', [  { color: { r: 1.0, g: 0.8, b: 0.2, a: 1.0 }, stop: 0 },  { color: { r: 0.3, g: 0.4, b: 0.7, a: 1.0 }, stop: 1 }]);
```

RGB values are normalized floats from 0.0 to 1.0. Stop positions are normalized where 0.0 represents the start and 1.0 represents the end. The alpha channel controls opacity per color stop.

### Getting Color Stops[#](#getting-color-stops)

Retrieve the current color stops from a gradient fill:

```
// Get gradient color stopsconst colorStops = engine.block.getGradientColorStops(  inspectGradient,  'fill/gradient/colors');// eslint-disable-next-line no-consoleconsole.log('Color stops:', colorStops);
```

### Using Different Color Spaces[#](#using-different-color-spaces)

Gradient color stops support multiple color spaces:

```
    const { block: cmykGradientBlock, fill: cmykGradient } =      createShapeWithFill('gradient/linear');
    // CMYK color stops for print    engine.block.setGradientColorStops(cmykGradient, 'fill/gradient/colors', [      { color: { c: 0.0, m: 1.0, y: 1.0, k: 0.0, tint: 1.0 }, stop: 0 },      { color: { c: 1.0, m: 0.0, y: 1.0, k: 0.0, tint: 1.0 }, stop: 1 }    ]);
    engine.block.setFloat(cmykGradient, 'fill/gradient/linear/startPointX', 0);    engine.block.setFloat(      cmykGradient,      'fill/gradient/linear/startPointY',      0.5    );    engine.block.setFloat(cmykGradient, 'fill/gradient/linear/endPointX', 1);    engine.block.setFloat(cmykGradient, 'fill/gradient/linear/endPointY', 0.5);
```

## Positioning Linear Gradients[#](#positioning-linear-gradients)

### Setting Start and End Points[#](#setting-start-and-end-points)

Linear gradients are positioned using start and end points with normalized coordinates (0.0 to 1.0) relative to block dimensions:

```
// Set vertical gradient (top to bottom)engine.block.setFloat(  linearVertical,  'fill/gradient/linear/startPointX',  0.5);engine.block.setFloat(  linearVertical,  'fill/gradient/linear/startPointY',  0);engine.block.setFloat(  linearVertical,  'fill/gradient/linear/endPointX',  0.5);engine.block.setFloat(linearVertical, 'fill/gradient/linear/endPointY', 1);
```

Coordinates are normalized where (0, 0) represents the top-left corner and (1, 1) represents the bottom-right corner.

### Common Linear Gradient Directions[#](#common-linear-gradient-directions)

**Horizontal (Left to Right):**

```
engine.block.setFloat(linearGradient, 'fill/gradient/linear/startPointX', 0);engine.block.setFloat(linearGradient, 'fill/gradient/linear/startPointY', 0.5);engine.block.setFloat(linearGradient, 'fill/gradient/linear/endPointX', 1);engine.block.setFloat(linearGradient, 'fill/gradient/linear/endPointY', 0.5);
```

**Diagonal (Top-Left to Bottom-Right):**

```
engine.block.setFloat(linearGradient, 'fill/gradient/linear/startPointX', 0);engine.block.setFloat(linearGradient, 'fill/gradient/linear/startPointY', 0);engine.block.setFloat(linearGradient, 'fill/gradient/linear/endPointX', 1);engine.block.setFloat(linearGradient, 'fill/gradient/linear/endPointY', 1);
```

### Getting Current Position[#](#getting-current-position)

Retrieve the current position values:

```
// Get linear gradient positionconst startX = engine.block.getFloat(  inspectGradient,  'fill/gradient/linear/startPointX');const startY = engine.block.getFloat(  inspectGradient,  'fill/gradient/linear/startPointY');const endX = engine.block.getFloat(  inspectGradient,  'fill/gradient/linear/endPointX');const endY = engine.block.getFloat(  inspectGradient,  'fill/gradient/linear/endPointY');// eslint-disable-next-line no-consoleconsole.log('Linear gradient position:', { startX, startY, endX, endY });
```

## Positioning Radial Gradients[#](#positioning-radial-gradients)

### Setting Center Point and Radius[#](#setting-center-point-and-radius)

Radial gradients are positioned using a center point and radius:

```
// Set center point (middle of block)engine.block.setFloat(  radialCentered,  'fill/gradient/radial/centerPointX',  0.5);engine.block.setFloat(  radialCentered,  'fill/gradient/radial/centerPointY',  0.5);engine.block.setFloat(radialCentered, 'fill/gradient/radial/radius', 0.8);
```

The `centerPointX/Y` properties use normalized coordinates (0.0 to 1.0) relative to block dimensions. The `radius` property is relative to the smaller side of the block frame, where 1.0 equals full coverage. Default values are centerX = 0.0, centerY = 0.0, and radius = 1.0.

### Common Radial Patterns[#](#common-radial-patterns)

**Centered Circle:**

```
engine.block.setFloat(radialGradient, 'fill/gradient/radial/centerPointX', 0.5);engine.block.setFloat(radialGradient, 'fill/gradient/radial/centerPointY', 0.5);engine.block.setFloat(radialGradient, 'fill/gradient/radial/radius', 0.7);
```

**Top-Left Highlight:**

```
engine.block.setFloat(radialGradient, 'fill/gradient/radial/centerPointX', 0);engine.block.setFloat(radialGradient, 'fill/gradient/radial/centerPointY', 0);engine.block.setFloat(radialGradient, 'fill/gradient/radial/radius', 1.0);
```

**Bottom-Right Vignette:**

```
engine.block.setFloat(radialGradient, 'fill/gradient/radial/centerPointX', 1);engine.block.setFloat(radialGradient, 'fill/gradient/radial/centerPointY', 1);engine.block.setFloat(radialGradient, 'fill/gradient/radial/radius', 1.5);
```

## Positioning Conical Gradients[#](#positioning-conical-gradients)

### Setting Center Point[#](#setting-center-point)

Conical gradients are positioned using a center point. The rotation starts at the top (12 o’clock) and proceeds clockwise:

```
// Set center point (middle of block)engine.block.setFloat(  conicalColorWheel,  'fill/gradient/conical/centerPointX',  0.5);engine.block.setFloat(  conicalColorWheel,  'fill/gradient/conical/centerPointY',  0.5);
```

The `centerPointX/Y` properties use normalized coordinates (0.0 to 1.0) relative to block dimensions. There is no separate rotation or angle property—the gradient always starts at the top. Default values are centerX = 0.0 and centerY = 0.0.

## Additional Techniques[#](#additional-techniques)

### Sharing Gradient Fills[#](#sharing-gradient-fills)

You can share a single gradient fill between multiple blocks. Changes to the shared gradient affect all blocks using it:

```
    const block1 = engine.block.create('graphic');    const shape1 = engine.block.createShape('rect');    engine.block.setShape(block1, shape1);    engine.block.setWidth(block1, blockWidth);    engine.block.setHeight(block1, blockHeight / 2 - 5);    engine.block.appendChild(page, block1);
    const block2 = engine.block.create('graphic');    const shape2 = engine.block.createShape('rect');    engine.block.setShape(block2, shape2);    engine.block.setWidth(block2, blockWidth);    engine.block.setHeight(block2, blockHeight / 2 - 5);    engine.block.appendChild(page, block2);
    // Create one gradient fill    const sharedGradient = engine.block.createFill('gradient/linear');    engine.block.setGradientColorStops(sharedGradient, 'fill/gradient/colors', [      { color: { r: 1, g: 0, b: 0, a: 1 }, stop: 0 },      { color: { r: 0, g: 0, b: 1, a: 1 }, stop: 1 }    ]);
    engine.block.setFloat(      sharedGradient,      'fill/gradient/linear/startPointX',      0    );    engine.block.setFloat(      sharedGradient,      'fill/gradient/linear/startPointY',      0.5    );    engine.block.setFloat(sharedGradient, 'fill/gradient/linear/endPointX', 1);    engine.block.setFloat(      sharedGradient,      'fill/gradient/linear/endPointY',      0.5    );
    // Apply to both blocks    engine.block.setFill(block1, sharedGradient);    engine.block.setFill(block2, sharedGradient);
    // Change gradient after a delay to show it affects both    setTimeout(() => {      engine.block.setGradientColorStops(        sharedGradient,        'fill/gradient/colors',        [          { color: { r: 0, g: 1, b: 0, a: 1 }, stop: 0 },          { color: { r: 1, g: 1, b: 0, a: 1 }, stop: 1 }        ]      );    }, 2000);
```

### Duplicating Gradient Fills[#](#duplicating-gradient-fills)

When you duplicate a block, its gradient fill is automatically duplicated, creating an independent copy. Each duplicate has its own fill instance that can be modified independently without affecting the original.

## Common Use Cases[#](#common-use-cases)

### Modern Hero Background (Aurora Effect)[#](#modern-hero-background-aurora-effect)

Create dreamy multi-color gradient backgrounds for hero sections:

    engine.block.setFloat(      auroraGradient,      'fill/gradient/linear/startPointX',      0    );    engine.block.setFloat(      auroraGradient,      'fill/gradient/linear/startPointY',      0.5    );    engine.block.setFloat(auroraGradient, 'fill/gradient/linear/endPointX', 1);    engine.block.setFloat(      auroraGradient,      'fill/gradient/linear/endPointY',      0.5    );
```

    // Set top-left highlight    engine.block.setFloat(      radialHighlight,      'fill/gradient/radial/centerPointX',      0    );    engine.block.setFloat(      radialHighlight,      'fill/gradient/radial/centerPointY',      0    );    engine.block.setFloat(radialHighlight, 'fill/gradient/radial/radius', 1.0);
```

### Loading Spinner (Conical)[#](#loading-spinner-conical)

Create circular progress indicators and loading animations with conical gradients:

    engine.block.setGradientColorStops(conicalSpinner, 'fill/gradient/colors', [      { color: { r: 0.2, g: 0.4, b: 0.8, a: 1 }, stop: 0 },      { color: { r: 0.2, g: 0.4, b: 0.8, a: 0 }, stop: 0.75 },      { color: { r: 0.2, g: 0.4, b: 0.8, a: 1 }, stop: 1 }    ]);
    engine.block.setFloat(      conicalSpinner,      'fill/gradient/conical/centerPointX',      0.5    );    engine.block.setFloat(      conicalSpinner,      'fill/gradient/conical/centerPointY',      0.5    );
```

### Transparency Overlay[#](#transparency-overlay)

Create smooth transparency effects with alpha channel transitions:

```
    const { block: overlayGradientBlock, fill: overlayGradient } =      createShapeWithFill('gradient/linear');
    engine.block.setGradientColorStops(      overlayGradient,      'fill/gradient/colors',      [        { color: { r: 0.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 0 }, stop: 0 },        { color: { r: 0.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 0.7 }, stop: 1 }      ]    );
    engine.block.setFloat(      overlayGradient,      'fill/gradient/linear/startPointX',      0.5    );    engine.block.setFloat(      overlayGradient,      'fill/gradient/linear/startPointY',      0    );    engine.block.setFloat(      overlayGradient,      'fill/gradient/linear/endPointX',      0.5    );    engine.block.setFloat(overlayGradient, 'fill/gradient/linear/endPointY', 1);
```

### Duotone Effect[#](#duotone-effect)

Create modern two-color gradient overlays:

```
    const { block: duotoneGradientBlock, fill: duotoneGradient } =      createShapeWithFill('gradient/linear');
    engine.block.setGradientColorStops(      duotoneGradient,      'fill/gradient/colors',      [        { color: { r: 0.8, g: 0.2, b: 0.9, a: 1 }, stop: 0 },        { color: { r: 0.2, g: 0.9, b: 0.8, a: 1 }, stop: 1 }      ]    );
    engine.block.setFloat(      duotoneGradient,      'fill/gradient/linear/startPointX',      0    );    engine.block.setFloat(      duotoneGradient,      'fill/gradient/linear/startPointY',      0    );    engine.block.setFloat(duotoneGradient, 'fill/gradient/linear/endPointX', 1);    engine.block.setFloat(duotoneGradient, 'fill/gradient/linear/endPointY', 1);
```

## Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting)

### Gradient Not Visible[#](#gradient-not-visible)

If your gradient doesn’t appear:

*   Check if fill is enabled: `engine.block.isFillEnabled(block)`
*   Verify color stops have visible colors (check alpha channels)
*   Ensure block has valid dimensions (width and height > 0)
*   Confirm block is in the scene hierarchy
*   Check if color stops are properly ordered by stop position

### Gradient Looks Different Than Expected[#](#gradient-looks-different-than-expected)

If the gradient doesn’t look right:

*   Verify color stop positions are between 0.0 and 1.0
*   Check gradient direction and positioning properties
*   Ensure correct gradient type is used (linear vs radial vs conical)
*   Review color space (RGB vs CMYK) for output medium
*   Confirm alpha values for transparency effects

### Gradient Direction Wrong[#](#gradient-direction-wrong)

If the gradient direction is incorrect:

*   For linear gradients, check `startPointX/Y` and `endPointX/Y` values
*   Remember coordinates are normalized (0.0 to 1.0), not pixels
*   Verify the block’s coordinate system and transformations
*   Test with simple horizontal or vertical gradients first

### Memory Leaks[#](#memory-leaks)

To prevent memory leaks:

*   Always destroy replaced gradients: `engine.block.destroy(oldFill)`
*   Don’t create gradient fills without attaching them to blocks
*   Clean up shared gradients when no longer needed

### Cannot Apply Gradient to Block[#](#cannot-apply-gradient-to-block)

If you can’t apply a gradient fill:

*   Verify block supports fills: `engine.block.supportsFill(block)`
*   Check if block has a shape: Some blocks require shapes
*   Ensure gradient fill object is valid and not already destroyed

### Color Stops Not Updating[#](#color-stops-not-updating)

If color stops don’t update:

*   Verify you’re calling `setGradientColorStops()` not `setColor()`
*   Ensure property name is exactly `'fill/gradient/colors'`
*   Check that color stop array is properly formatted
*   Confirm fill ID is correct and still valid

# Create a Custom LUT Filter

```
<!doctype html><html lang="en">  <head>    <meta charset="UTF-8" />    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />    <style>      body {        margin: 0;        overflow: hidden;      }      html {        overscroll-behavior-x: contain;      }    </style>  </head>

```

We use a technology called Lookup Tables (LUTs) in order to add new filters to our SDK. The main idea is that colors respond to operations that are carried out during the filtering process. We ‘record’ that very response by applying the filter to the identity image shown below.

![Identity LUT](content-assets/6e3f49/identity.png)

The resulting image can be used within our SDK and the recorded changes can then be applied to any image by looking up the transformed colors in the modified LUT.

If you want to create a new filter, you’ll need to [download](content-assets/6e3f49/imgly_lut_ad1920_5_5_128.png) the identity LUT shown above, load it into an image editing software of your choice, apply your operations, save it and add it to your app.

> **WARNING:** As any compression artifacts in the edited LUT could lead to distorted results when applying the filter, you need to save your LUT as a PNG file.

## Using Custom Filters[#](#using-custom-filters)

In this example, we will use a hosted CDN LUT filter file. First we will load one of our demo scenes and change the first image to use LUT filter we will provide. We will also configure the necessary setting based on the file.

LUT file we will use:

![Color grading LUT showcasing a grid of color variations used for applying a specific visual style to images.](content-assets/6e3f49/imgly_lut_ad1920_5_5_128.png)

## Load Scene[#](#load-scene)

After the setup, we create a new scene. Within this scene, we create a page, set its dimensions, and append it to the scene. Lastly, we adjust the zoom level to properly fit the page into the view.

```
const page = engine.block.create('page');engine.block.setWidth(page, 100);engine.block.setHeight(page, 100);engine.block.appendChild(scene, page);engine.scene.zoomToBlock(page, 40, 40, 40, 40);
```

## Create Rectangle[#](#create-rectangle)

Next, we create a rectangle with defined dimensions and append it to the page. We will apply our LUT filter to this rectangle.

```
const rect = engine.block.create('graphic');engine.block.setShape(rect, engine.block.createShape('rect'));engine.block.setWidth(rect, 100);engine.block.setHeight(rect, 100);engine.block.appendChild(page, rect);
```

## Load Image[#](#load-image)

After creating the rectangle, we create an image fill with a specified URL. This will load the image as a fill for the rectangle to which we will apply the LUT filter.

```
const imageFill = engine.block.createFill('image');engine.block.setString(  imageFill,  'fill/image/imageFileURI',  'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1.jpg');
```

## Create LUT Filter[#](#create-lut-filter)

Now, we create a Look-Up Table (LUT) filter effect. We enable the filter, set its intensity, and provide a URL for the LUT file. We also define the tile count for the filter. The LUT filter effect is then applied to the rectangle and image should appear black and white.

```
  const lutFilter = engine.block.createEffect('lut_filter');  engine.block.setBool(lutFilter, 'effect/enabled', true);  engine.block.setFloat(lutFilter, 'effect/lut_filter/intensity', 0.9);  engine.block.setString(    lutFilter,    'effect/lut_filter/lutFileURI',    'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/assets/extensions/ly.img.cesdk.filters.lut/LUTs/imgly_lut_ad1920_5_5_128.png'  );
  engine.block.setInt(lutFilter, 'effect/lut_filter/verticalTileCount', 5);  engine.block.setInt(lutFilter, 'effect/lut_filter/horizontalTileCount', 5);
```

## Apply LUT Filter[#](#apply-lut-filter)

Finally, we apply the LUT filter effect to the rectangle, and set the image fill to the rectangle. Before setting an image fill, we destroy the default rectangle fill.

```
engine.block.appendEffect(rect, lutFilter);engine.block.setFill(rect, imageFill);
```

Here’s the full code:

```
import CreativeEngine from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: import.meta.env.VITE_CESDK_LICENSE,  userId: 'guides-user'  // baseURL: 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/assets'};

  const rect = engine.block.create('graphic');  engine.block.setShape(rect, engine.block.createShape('rect'));  engine.block.setWidth(rect, 100);  engine.block.setHeight(rect, 100);  engine.block.appendChild(page, rect);

# Blur

```
// Create and configure a radial blurconst radialBlur = engine.block.createBlur('radial');
engine.block.setFloat(radialBlur, 'radial/radius', 100);engine.block.setBlur(block, radialBlur);engine.block.setBlurEnabled(block, true);const isBlurEnabled = engine.block.isBlurEnabled(block);
// Access an existing blurif (engine.block.supportsBlur(block)) {  const existingBlur = engine.block.getBlur(block);}
```

In this example, we will show you how to use the [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk)’s CreativeEngine to modify a block’s blur through the `block` API. Blurs can be added to any shape or page. You can create and configure individual blurs and apply them to blocks. Blocks support at most one blur at a time. The same blur may be used for different blocks at the same time.

## Creating a Blur[#](#creating-a-blur)

To create a blur, simply use `createBlur`.

```
createBlur(type: BlurType): DesignBlockId
```

Create a new blur, fails if type is unknown or not a valid blur type.

*   `type`: The type id of the block.
*   Returns The handle of the newly created blur.

We currently support the following blur types:

*   `'//ly.img.ubq/blur/uniform'`
*   `'//ly.img.ubq/blur/linear'`
*   `'//ly.img.ubq/blur/mirrored'`
*   `'//ly.img.ubq/blur/radial'`

Note: Omitting the prefix is also accepted, e.g. `'uniform'` instead of `'//ly.img.ubq/blur/uniform'`.

```
// Create and configure a radial blurconst radialBlur = engine.block.createBlur('radial');
```

## Configuring a Blur[#](#configuring-a-blur)

You can configure blurs just like you configure design blocks. See [Modify Properties](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/) for more detail.

```
engine.block.setFloat(radialBlur, 'radial/radius', 100);engine.block.setBlur(block, radialBlur);engine.block.setBlurEnabled(block, true);const isBlurEnabled = engine.block.isBlurEnabled(block);
```

## Functions[#](#functions)

```
setBlur(id: DesignBlockId, blurId: DesignBlockId): void
```

Connects `block`’s blur to the given `blur` block. Required scope: ‘appearance/blur’

*   `id`: The block to update.
*   `blurId`: A ‘blur’ block.

```
setBlurEnabled(id: DesignBlockId, enabled: boolean): void
```

Enable or disable the blur of the given design block.

*   `id`: The block to update.
*   `enabled`: The new enabled value.

```
isBlurEnabled(id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Query if blur is enabled for the given block.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns True, if the blur is enabled. False otherwise.

```
supportsBlur(id: DesignBlockId): boolean
```

Checks whether the block supports blur.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns True, if the block supports blur.

```
getBlur(id: DesignBlockId): DesignBlockId
```

Get the ‘blur’ block of the given design block.

*   `id`: The block to query.
*   Returns The ‘blur’ block.

## Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here’s the full code:

```
// Create and configure a radial blurconst radialBlur = engine.block.createBlur('radial');engine.block.setFloat(radialBlur, 'radial/radius', 100);engine.block.setBlur(block, radialBlur);engine.block.setBlurEnabled(block, true);const isBlurEnabled = engine.block.isBlurEnabled(block);
// Access an existing blurif (engine.block.supportsBlur(block)) {  const existingBlur = engine.block.getBlur(block);}
```

# Apply Filters and Effects

Apply professional color grading, blur effects, and artistic treatments to design elements using CE.SDK’s visual effects system.

While CE.SDK uses a unified effect API for both filters and effects, they serve different purposes. **Filters** typically apply color transformations like LUT filters and duotone, while **effects** apply visual modifications such as blur, pixelize, vignette, and image adjustments. You can combine multiple effects on a single element, creating complex visual treatments by stacking them in a customizable order.

    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log(      'Effects guide initialized. Select any image to see effects panel.'    );  }}
export default Example;
```

This guide covers how to enable the built-in effects panel for interactive editing and how to apply and manage effects programmatically using the block API.

## Using the Built-in Effects UI[#](#using-the-built-in-effects-ui)

### Enable Effects Features[#](#enable-effects-features)

To give users access to effects in the inspector panel, we enable the effects features using CE.SDK’s Feature API. Effects and filters appear in the **inspector bar** and **advanced inspector** when a user selects a supported element.

```
// Enable effects and filters in the inspector panel using the Feature APIcesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.effect'); // Enable all effectscesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.filter'); // Enable all filterscesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.blur'); // Enable blur effectcesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.adjustment'); // Enable adjustments
```

The Feature API controls which capabilities are available to users. By enabling `ly.img.effect` and `ly.img.filter`, the inspector panel displays effect and filter options when users select compatible blocks. You can also enable specific effects individually like `ly.img.blur` or `ly.img.adjustment` for more granular control.

Effects are enabled by default for graphic blocks with image or video fills. The Feature API shown above allows you to control which specific effects appear in the inspector panel UI.

### User Workflow[#](#user-workflow)

With effects features enabled, users can enhance their designs through a visual workflow in the inspector panel:

1.  **Select an element** - Click on any image or supported graphic block in the canvas
2.  **Access inspector** - The inspector panel shows available options for the selected element
3.  **Find effects section** - Scroll to the effects and filters sections within the inspector
4.  **Browse and apply** - Click through available effects to apply them
5.  **Adjust parameters** - Use sliders and controls to fine-tune intensity and other effect properties
6.  **Manage effects** - Toggle effects on/off, switch between effects, or reset effect parameters

Effects are applied immediately when selected. CE.SDK does not currently support live preview mode when browsing effects before application. Effect reordering is not supported—use toggle on/off, switch, or reset operations to manage applied effects.

This interactive approach is perfect for creative exploration and allows users to see results immediately without any coding knowledge.

## Programmatic Effect Application[#](#programmatic-effect-application)

### Initialize CE.SDK[#](#initialize-cesdk)

For applications that need to apply effects programmatically—whether for automation, batch processing, or dynamic user experiences—we start by setting up CE.SDK with the proper configuration.

    // Initialize CE.SDK with Design mode and load asset sources    await cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();    await cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({      sceneMode: 'Design',      withUploadAssetSources: true    });    await cesdk.createDesignScene();
    const engine = cesdk.engine;    const page = engine.block.findByType('page')[0];
    // Set page dimensions    engine.block.setWidth(page, 800);    engine.block.setHeight(page, 600);
    const pageWidth = engine.block.getWidth(page);    const pageHeight = engine.block.getHeight(page);
```

This initializes the full CE.SDK interface with the effects panel enabled, giving you both UI and API access to the effects system.

### Check Effect Support[#](#check-effect-support)

Before applying effects to a block, we check whether it supports them. Not all block types can have effects applied—for example, page blocks and scene blocks do not support effects.

```
    // Pattern #2: Use Convenience APIs - addImage() simplifies block creation    // Create a sample block to demonstrate effect support checking    const blockSize = { width: blockWidth, height: blockHeight };    const sampleBlock = await engine.block.addImage(imageUri, {      size: blockSize    });    engine.block.appendChild(page, sampleBlock);
    // Check if a block supports effects    const supportsEffects = engine.block.supportsEffects(sampleBlock);    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log('Block supports effects:', supportsEffects); // true for graphics
    // Page blocks don't support effects    const pageSupportsEffects = engine.block.supportsEffects(page);    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log('Page supports effects:', pageSupportsEffects); // false
    // Select this block so effects panel is visible    engine.block.setSelected(sampleBlock, true);
```

Effect support is available for:

*   **Graphic blocks** with image fills
*   **Graphic blocks** with video fills (with performance considerations)
*   **Shape blocks** with fills
*   **Text blocks** (with limited effect types)
*   **Page blocks** (particularly when they have fills applied, such as background fills)

Always verify support before creating and applying effects to avoid errors and ensure a smooth user experience.

### Apply Basic Effects[#](#apply-basic-effects)

Once we’ve confirmed a block supports effects, we can create and apply effects using the effect API. Here we create a separate image block using the convenience `addImage()` API and apply a blur effect to it.

The example code uses the `engine.block.addImage()` convenience API throughout this guide. This built-in helper simplifies image block creation compared to manually constructing graphic blocks with image fills, and provides additional configuration options like positioning, sizing, corner radius, shadows, and timeline properties.

```
    // Pattern #1: Demonstrate Individual Before Combined    // Create a separate image block for blur demonstration    const blurImageBlock = await engine.block.addImage(imageUri, {      size: blockSize    });    engine.block.appendChild(page, blurImageBlock);
    // Create and apply a blur effect    const blurEffect = engine.block.createEffect('extrude_blur');    engine.block.appendEffect(blurImageBlock, blurEffect);
    // Adjust blur intensity    engine.block.setFloat(blurEffect, 'effect/extrude_blur/amount', 0.5);
```

CE.SDK provides several built-in effect types:

*   `extrude_blur` - Gaussian blur with configurable intensity
*   `adjustments` - Brightness, contrast, saturation, exposure
*   `pixelize` - Pixelation effect
*   `vignette` - Darkened corners
*   `half_tone` - Halftone pattern
*   `lut_filter` - Color grading with LUT files
*   `duotone` - Two-color tinting

`extrude_blur` is the only blur available as an effect. CE.SDK also provides additional blur types in a separate blur category.

Each effect type has its own set of configurable properties that control its visual appearance.

### Configure Effect Parameters[#](#configure-effect-parameters)

After creating an effect, we can customize its appearance by setting properties. Each effect exposes different parameters depending on its type and capabilities.

```
    // Create a separate image block for adjustments demonstration    const adjustmentsImageBlock = await engine.block.addImage(imageUri, {      size: blockSize    });    engine.block.appendChild(page, adjustmentsImageBlock);
    // Create adjustments effect for brightness and contrast    const adjustmentsEffect = engine.block.createEffect('adjustments');    engine.block.appendEffect(adjustmentsImageBlock, adjustmentsEffect);
    // Find all available properties for this effect    const adjustmentProperties =      engine.block.findAllProperties(adjustmentsEffect);    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log('Available adjustment properties:', adjustmentProperties);
    // Set brightness, contrast, and saturation    engine.block.setFloat(      adjustmentsEffect,      'effect/adjustments/brightness',      0.2    );    engine.block.setFloat(      adjustmentsEffect,      'effect/adjustments/contrast',      0.15    );    engine.block.setFloat(      adjustmentsEffect,      'effect/adjustments/saturation',      0.1    );
```

CE.SDK provides typed setter methods for different parameter types:

*   **`setFloat()`** - For intensity, amount, and radius values (typically 0.0 to 1.0)
*   **`setInt()`** - For discrete values like pixel sizes
*   **`setString()`** - For file URIs (LUT files, image references)
*   **`setBool()`** - For enabling or disabling specific features

Using the correct setter method ensures type safety and proper value validation.

### Apply LUT Filters[#](#apply-lut-filters)

LUT (Look-Up Table) filters apply professional color grading by transforming colors through a predefined mapping. These are particularly useful for creating consistent brand aesthetics or applying cinematic color treatments.

The example demonstrates querying LUT filters from the asset library using `engine.asset.findAssets('ly.img.filter.lut')`, then applying them using metadata from the asset results. This approach matches how CE.SDK’s built-in filter panel works.

```
    // Demonstrate LUT filters by applying the first 2 from asset library    // These filters are fetched from the demo asset sources (Grid positions 3-4)    const lutImageBlocks = [];    for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(2, lutAssets.length); i++) {      const lutAsset = lutAssets[i];
      const lutImageBlock = await engine.block.addImage(imageUri, {        size: blockSize      });      engine.block.appendChild(page, lutImageBlock);      lutImageBlocks.push(lutImageBlock);
      // Create LUT filter effect using the full effect type URI      const lutEffect = engine.block.createEffect(        '//ly.img.ubq/effect/lut_filter'      );
      // Use asset metadata for LUT configuration      // The asset provides the LUT file URI and grid dimensions      engine.block.setString(        lutEffect,        'effect/lut_filter/lutFileURI',        lutAsset.meta?.uri as string      );      engine.block.setInt(        lutEffect,        'effect/lut_filter/horizontalTileCount',        parseInt(lutAsset.meta?.horizontalTileCount as string, 10)      );      engine.block.setInt(        lutEffect,        'effect/lut_filter/verticalTileCount',        parseInt(lutAsset.meta?.verticalTileCount as string, 10)      );      engine.block.setFloat(lutEffect, 'effect/lut_filter/intensity', 0.85);
      engine.block.appendEffect(lutImageBlock, lutEffect);    }
```

LUT filters are ideal for:

*   Creating consistent brand aesthetics across all designs
*   Applying cinematic or film-style color grading
*   Matching reference images or maintaining color continuity
*   Building curated filter collections for users

**Asset metadata structure**: Each LUT asset provides `uri` (the LUT file URL), `horizontalTileCount`, and `verticalTileCount` describing the grid layout of color transformation cubes.

### Apply Duotone Filters[#](#apply-duotone-filters)

Duotone filters create artistic two-color effects by mapping image tones to two colors (dark and light). This effect is popular for creating stylized visuals, vintage aesthetics, or brand-specific color treatments.

The example queries duotone filters from the asset library, then applies them using color metadata. The `hexToRgba` utility converts hex color values from asset metadata to RGBA format required by the `setColorRGBA` API.

```
    // Demonstrate Duotone filters by applying the first 2 from asset library    // Duotone filters create artistic two-color treatments (Grid positions 5-6)    const duotoneImageBlocks = [];    for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(2, duotoneAssets.length); i++) {      const duotoneAsset = duotoneAssets[i];
      const duotoneImageBlock = await engine.block.addImage(imageUri, {        size: blockSize      });      engine.block.appendChild(page, duotoneImageBlock);      duotoneImageBlocks.push(duotoneImageBlock);
      // Create Duotone filter effect using the full effect type URI      const duotoneEffect = engine.block.createEffect(        '//ly.img.ubq/effect/duotone_filter'      );
      // Convert hex colors from asset metadata to RGBA (0-1 range)      const darkColor = hexToRgba(duotoneAsset.meta?.darkColor as string);      engine.block.setColor(        duotoneEffect,        'effect/duotone_filter/darkColor',        darkColor      );
      const lightColor = hexToRgba(duotoneAsset.meta?.lightColor as string);      engine.block.setColor(        duotoneEffect,        'effect/duotone_filter/lightColor',        lightColor      );
      engine.block.setFloat(        duotoneEffect,        'effect/duotone_filter/intensity',        0.8      );
      engine.block.appendEffect(duotoneImageBlock, duotoneEffect);    }
```

Duotone filters work by:

*   Mapping darker image tones to the **dark color**
*   Mapping lighter image tones to the **light color**
*   Blending between the two colors based on pixel brightness
*   Adjusting intensity to control the effect strength (0.0 to 1.0)

**Asset metadata structure**: Each duotone asset provides `darkColor` and `lightColor` as hex strings (e.g., `"#1a2b3c"`) which must be converted to RGBA values for the effect API.

### Combine Multiple Effects[#](#combine-multiple-effects)

One of the most powerful features of CE.SDK’s effect system is the ability to stack multiple effects on a single block. Each effect is applied sequentially, allowing you to build complex visual treatments.

The example code demonstrates each effect type individually on separate image blocks before showing them combined. This educational approach helps you understand what each effect does before seeing them work together. In your production code, you can apply multiple effects directly to the same block without this separation.

```
    // Pattern #5: Progressive Complexity - now combining multiple effects    // Create a separate image block to demonstrate combining multiple effects (Grid position 7)    const combinedImageBlock = await engine.block.addImage(imageUri, {      size: blockSize    });    engine.block.appendChild(page, combinedImageBlock);
    // Apply effects in order - the stack will contain:    // 1. adjustments (brightness/contrast) - applied first    // 2. blur - applied second    // 3. duotone (color tinting) - applied third    // 4. pixelize - applied last
    const combinedAdjustments = engine.block.createEffect('adjustments');    engine.block.appendEffect(combinedImageBlock, combinedAdjustments);    engine.block.setFloat(      combinedAdjustments,      'effect/adjustments/brightness',      0.2    );    engine.block.setFloat(      combinedAdjustments,      'effect/adjustments/contrast',      0.15    );
    const combinedBlur = engine.block.createEffect('extrude_blur');    engine.block.appendEffect(combinedImageBlock, combinedBlur);    engine.block.setFloat(combinedBlur, 'effect/extrude_blur/amount', 0.3);
    const combinedDuotone = engine.block.createEffect('duotone_filter');    engine.block.appendEffect(combinedImageBlock, combinedDuotone);    engine.block.setColor(combinedDuotone, 'duotone_filter/darkColor', {      r: 0.1,      g: 0.2,      b: 0.4,      a: 1.0    });    engine.block.setColor(combinedDuotone, 'duotone_filter/lightColor', {      r: 0.9,      g: 0.8,      b: 0.6,      a: 1.0    });    engine.block.setFloat(combinedDuotone, 'duotone_filter/intensity', 0.6);
    const pixelizeEffect = engine.block.createEffect('pixelize');    engine.block.appendEffect(combinedImageBlock, pixelizeEffect);    engine.block.setInt(pixelizeEffect, 'pixelize/horizontalPixelSize', 8);    engine.block.setInt(pixelizeEffect, 'pixelize/verticalPixelSize', 8);
```

**Effect ordering matters**: Effects are applied from the bottom of the stack to the top. In this example:

1.  First, we adjust brightness and contrast
2.  Then, we apply blur
3.  Then, we apply color grading with a LUT filter
4.  Finally, we add stylization with pixelization

Experiment with different orderings to achieve the desired visual result—changing the order can significantly impact the final appearance.

## Managing Applied Effects[#](#managing-applied-effects)

### List and Access Effects[#](#list-and-access-effects)

We can retrieve all effects applied to a block and inspect their properties. This is useful for building effect management interfaces or debugging effect configurations.

```
    // Get all effects applied to the combined block    const effects = engine.block.getEffects(combinedImageBlock);    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console    console.log('Applied effects:', effects);
    // Access properties of specific effects    effects.forEach((effect, index) => {      const effectType = engine.block.getType(effect);      const isEnabled = engine.block.isEffectEnabled(effect);      // eslint-disable-next-line no-console      console.log(`Effect ${index}: ${effectType}, enabled: ${isEnabled}`);    });
```

This allows you to iterate through all applied effects, read their properties, and make modifications as needed.

### Enable/Disable Effects[#](#enabledisable-effects)

CE.SDK allows you to temporarily toggle effects on and off without removing them from the block. This is particularly useful for before/after comparisons or when you need to optimize rendering performance during interactive editing sessions.

```
// Check if effect is enabledconst isBlurEnabled = engine.block.isEffectEnabled(combinedBlur);// eslint-disable-next-line no-consoleconsole.log('Blur effect is enabled:', isBlurEnabled);
```

When you disable an effect, it remains attached to the block but won’t be rendered until you enable it again. This preserves all effect parameters while giving you full control over when the effect is applied.

You can use this feature to create interactive preview modes, implement undo-like functionality, or conditionally apply effects based on user preferences or device capabilities.

### Remove Effects[#](#remove-effects)

When you no longer need an effect, you can remove it from the effect stack and free its resources. Always destroy effects that are no longer in use to prevent memory leaks.

```
    // Create a temporary block to demonstrate effect removal    const tempBlock = await engine.block.addImage(imageUri, {      size: blockSize    });    engine.block.appendChild(page, tempBlock);
    const tempEffect = engine.block.createEffect('pixelize');    engine.block.appendEffect(tempBlock, tempEffect);    engine.block.setInt(tempEffect, 'pixelize/horizontalPixelSize', 12);
    // Remove the effect    const tempEffects = engine.block.getEffects(tempBlock);    const effectIndex = tempEffects.indexOf(tempEffect);    if (effectIndex !== -1) {      engine.block.removeEffect(tempBlock, effectIndex);    }
    // Destroy the removed effect to free memory    engine.block.destroy(tempEffect);
```

The `removeEffect()` method takes an index position, so you can remove effects selectively from any position in the stack. After removal, destroy the effect instance to ensure proper cleanup.

## Additional Techniques[#](#additional-techniques)

### Batch Processing[#](#batch-processing)

For applications that need to apply the same effects to multiple elements, we can iterate through a collection of blocks and apply effects efficiently.

```
    // Apply same effects to multiple blocks    const allGraphics = engine.block.findByType('graphic');
    allGraphics.forEach((graphic) => {      if (engine.block.supportsEffects(graphic)) {        // Only apply to blocks that don't already have effects        const existingEffects = engine.block.getEffects(graphic);        if (existingEffects.length === 0) {          const effect = engine.block.createEffect('adjustments');          engine.block.appendEffect(graphic, effect);          engine.block.setFloat(effect, 'effect/adjustments/brightness', 0.1);        }      }    });
```

When batch processing, check effect support before creating effects to avoid unnecessary work. You can also reuse effect instances when applying the same configuration to multiple blocks, though be careful to destroy them properly when done.

### Dynamic Effects in Video Mode[#](#dynamic-effects-in-video-mode)

When working in Video mode (not Design mode), you can combine effects with CE.SDK’s built-in animation system to create dynamic visual treatments that change over time.

Effect parameters are static properties and cannot be animated using JavaScript timers like `setInterval` or `requestAnimationFrame`. For animated content, use CE.SDK’s built-in animation blocks (`createAnimation()`, `setInAnimation()`, etc.) in Video mode or refer to the animation guides.

For dynamic visual effects in video projects, explore CE.SDK’s animation system which provides professionally designed transitions and effects that integrate seamlessly with the rendering pipeline.

### Custom Effect Combinations[#](#custom-effect-combinations)

Creating reusable effect presets allows you to maintain consistent styling across your application and speed up common effect applications. Here’s a pattern for building reusable effect configurations:

```
// Create a reusable preset functionasync function applyVintagePreset(engine: CreativeEngine, imageBlock: number) {  // Apply LUT filter  const lutEffect = engine.block.createEffect('lut_filter');  engine.block.setString(    lutEffect,    'lut_filter/lutFileURI',    'https://img.ly/static/ubq_luts/vintage.png',  );  engine.block.appendEffect(imageBlock, lutEffect);
  // Add vignette  const vignetteEffect = engine.block.createEffect('vignette');  engine.block.setFloat(vignetteEffect, 'vignette/intensity', 0.5);  engine.block.appendEffect(imageBlock, vignetteEffect);
  return { lutEffect, vignetteEffect };}
// Use the presetconst effects = await applyVintagePreset(engine, myImageBlock);
```

Preset strategies include:

*   **Brand filters** - Maintain a consistent look across campaigns
*   **Style templates** - Provide quick application of complex multi-effect treatments
*   **User favorites** - Allow users to save and recall their preferred settings

## Performance Considerations[#](#performance-considerations)

CE.SDK’s effect system is optimized for real-time performance, but understanding these considerations helps you build responsive applications:

*   **GPU acceleration**: Effects leverage GPU rendering for smooth performance on modern devices
*   **Mobile optimization**: Limit effects to 2-3 per element on mobile devices to maintain responsiveness
*   **Effect complexity**: Blur and LUT filters are computationally expensive compared to simple adjustments
*   **Video effects**: Apply effects sparingly to video blocks to maintain smooth playback
*   **Real-time editing**: Temporarily disable effects during intensive editing operations for better interactivity

Test your effect combinations on target devices early in development to ensure acceptable performance.

## Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting)

### Effect Not Visible[#](#effect-not-visible)

If an effect doesn’t appear after applying it, check these common issues:

*   Verify the block type supports effects using `supportsEffects()`
*   Check that the effect is enabled with `isEffectEnabled()`
*   Ensure effect parameters are in valid ranges (e.g., intensity values between 0.0 and 1.0)
*   Confirm the effect is in the effect stack with `getEffects()`

### Performance Degradation[#](#performance-degradation)

If you experience slow rendering or laggy interactions:

*   Reduce the number of effects per element (aim for 2-3 maximum on mobile)
*   Lower blur radius values or use smaller LUT files
*   Temporarily disable effects during editing with `setEffectEnabled()`
*   Test on target devices early to identify performance bottlenecks

### Effects Not Persisting[#](#effects-not-persisting)

Effects should save automatically with the scene, but verify:

*   You’re not destroying effects prematurely before saving
*   Save/load operations complete successfully
*   Effect URIs (LUT files, images) remain accessible after loading

### Incompatible Block Types[#](#incompatible-block-types)

If you can’t apply an effect:

*   Remember that graphic blocks (with image or video fills), shape blocks, and text blocks support effects
*   Page blocks themselves don’t support effects directly, but page fills (such as background fills) do support effects
*   Scene blocks cannot have effects applied
*   Check the block type with `block.getType()` and use `block.supportsEffects()` before attempting to apply effects

## API Reference[#](#api-reference)

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `block.supportsEffects(block)` | Check if a block supports effects |
| `block.createEffect(type)` | Create a new effect instance |
| `block.appendEffect(block, effect)` | Add effect to the end of the effect stack |
| `block.insertEffect(block, effect, index)` | Insert effect at a specific position |
| `block.removeEffect(block, index)` | Remove effect at the specified index |
| `block.getEffects(block)` | Get all effects applied to a block |
| `block.setEffectEnabled(effect, enabled)` | Enable or disable an effect |
| `block.isEffectEnabled(effect)` | Check if an effect is currently enabled |
| `block.findAllProperties(effect)` | Get all available properties for an effect |
| `block.setFloat(effect, property, value)` | Set a floating-point property value |
| `block.setInt(effect, property, value)` | Set an integer property value |

| `block.setBool(effect, property, value)` | Set a boolean property value |
| `block.destroy(effect)` | Destroy an unused effect instance |

## About the Example Code[#](#about-the-example-code)

The example code accompanying this guide follows educational design patterns to help you learn effectively:

*   **Individual demonstrations**: Each effect type is demonstrated on its own image block before showing combinations, making it easier to understand what each effect does
*   **Convenience API usage**: The code uses `engine.block.addImage()` instead of manual block construction—this is the recommended approach for simplicity and maintainability
*   **Spatial layout**: Image blocks are positioned in a grid layout (x/y coordinates) so you can visually see the results of each effect when running the example
*   **Progressive complexity**: The example starts with simple single effects and gradually builds to complex multi-effect combinations

In your production code, you can apply multiple effects directly to the same block without creating separate demonstration blocks. The example structure is optimized for learning, not production usage.

## Next Steps[#](#next-steps)

Now that you understand how to apply and manage filters and effects, explore specific effect types and advanced techniques:

*   **LUT Filters** - Create custom color grading filters for cinematic looks
*   **Blur Effects** - Apply depth of field and motion blur techniques
*   **Duotone Effects** - Create striking two-color artistic treatments
*   **Adjustments** - Fine-tune brightness, contrast, and saturation
*   **Effect Combinations** - Build sophisticated multi-effect visual treatments

```

Some [design blocks](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/) in CE.SDK such as pages and graphic blocks allow you to add effects to them. An effect can modify the visual output of a block’s [fill](nextjs/fills-402ddc/). CreativeEditor SDK supports many different types of effects, such as adjustments, LUT filters, pixelization, glow, vignette and more.

Similarly to blocks, each effect instance has a numeric id which can be used to query and [modify its properties](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/).

We create a scene containing a graphic block with an image fill and want to apply effects to this image.

```
import CreativeEngine from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: import.meta.env.VITE_CESDK_LICENSE,  userId: 'guides-user'  // baseURL: 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/assets'};
CreativeEngine.init(config).then(async (engine) => {  document.getElementById('cesdk_container').append(engine.element);
  const scene = engine.scene.create();
  const page = engine.block.create('page');  engine.block.setWidth(page, 800);  engine.block.setHeight(page, 600);  engine.block.appendChild(scene, page);
  engine.scene.zoomToBlock(page, 40, 40, 40, 40);
  const block = engine.block.create('graphic');  engine.block.setShape(block, engine.block.createShape('rect'));  const imageFill = engine.block.createFill('image');  engine.block.setString(    imageFill,    'fill/image/imageFileURI',    'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1.jpg'  );  engine.block.setFill(block, imageFill);  engine.block.setPositionX(block, 100);  engine.block.setPositionY(block, 50);  engine.block.setWidth(block, 300);  engine.block.setHeight(block, 300);  engine.block.appendChild(page, block);
```

## Accessing Effects[#](#accessing-effects)

Not all types of design blocks support effects, so you should always first call the `supportsEffects(id: number): boolean` API before accessing any of the following APIs.

```
engine.block.supportsEffects(scene); // Returns falseengine.block.supportsEffects(block); // Returns true
```

## Creating an Effect[#](#creating-an-effect)

In order to add effects to our block, we first have to create a new effect instance, which we can do by calling `createEffect(type: EffectType): number` and passing it the type of effect that we want. In this example, we create a pixelization and an adjustment effect.

Please refer to [API Docs](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/) for a complete list of supported effect types.

```
const pixelize = engine.block.createEffect('pixelize');const adjustments = engine.block.createEffect('adjustments');
```

## Adding Effects[#](#adding-effects)

Now we have two effects but the output of our scene looks exactly the same as before. That is because we still need to append these effects to the graphic design block’s list of effects, which we can do by calling `appendEffect(id: number, effect: number): void`.

We can also insert or remove effects from specific indices of a block’s effect list using the `insertEffect(id: number, effect: number, index: number): void` and `removeEffect(id: number, index: number): void` APIs.

Effects will be applied to the block in the order they are placed in the block’s effects list. If the same effect appears multiple times in the list, it will also be applied multiple times. In our case, the adjustments effect will be applied to the image first, before the result of that is then pixelated.

```
engine.block.appendEffect(block, pixelize);engine.block.insertEffect(block, adjustments, 0);// engine.block.removeEffect(rect, 0);
```

## Querying Effects[#](#querying-effects)

Use the `getEffects(id: number): number[]` API to query the ordered list of effect ids of a block.

```
// This will return [adjustments, pixelize]const effectsList = engine.block.getEffects(block);
```

## Destroying Effects[#](#destroying-effects)

If we created an effect that we don’t want anymore, we have to make sure to destroy it using the same `destroy(id: number): void` API that we also call for design blocks.

Effects that are attached to a design block will be automatically destroyed when the design block is destroyed.

```
const unusedEffect = engine.block.createEffect('half_tone');engine.block.destroy(unusedEffect);
```

## Effect Properties[#](#effect-properties)

Just like design blocks, effects with different types have different properties that you can query and modify via the API. Use `findAllProperties(id: number): string[]` in order to get a list of all properties of a given effect.

Please refer to the [API Docs](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/) for a complete list of all available properties for each type of effect.

```
const allPixelizeProperties = engine.block.findAllProperties(pixelize);const allAdjustmentProperties = engine.block.findAllProperties(adjustments);
```

Once we know the property keys of an effect, we can use the same APIs as for design blocks in order to [modify those properties](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/).

Our adjustment effect here for example will not modify the output unless we at least change one of its adjustment properties - such as the brightness - to not be zero.

```
engine.block.setInt(pixelize, 'pixelize/horizontalPixelSize', 20);engine.block.setFloat(adjustments, 'effect/adjustments/brightness', 0.2);
```

## Disabling Effects[#](#disabling-effects)

You can temporarily disable and enable the individual effects using the `setEffectEnabled(id: number, enabled: boolean): void` API. When the effects are applied to a block, all disabled effects are simply skipped. Whether an effect is currently enabled or disabled can be queried with `isEffectEnabled(id: number): boolean`.

```
engine.block.setEffectEnabled(pixelize, false);engine.block.setEffectEnabled(  pixelize,  !engine.block.isEffectEnabled(pixelize));
```

## Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here’s the full code:

```
import CreativeEngine from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',  userId: 'guides-user',  baseURL:    'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/assets',};
CreativeEngine.init(config).then(async engine => {  document.getElementById('cesdk_container').append(engine.element);
  const scene = engine.scene.create();
  const page = engine.block.create('page');  engine.block.setWidth(page, 800);  engine.block.setHeight(page, 600);  engine.block.appendChild(scene, page);
  engine.scene.zoomToBlock(page, 40, 40, 40, 40);
  const block = engine.block.create('graphic');  engine.block.setShape(block, engine.block.createShape('rect'));  const imageFill = engine.block.createFill('image');  engine.block.setString(    imageFill,    'fill/image/imageFileURI',    'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1.jpg',  );  engine.block.setFill(block, imageFill);  engine.block.setPositionX(block, 100);  engine.block.setPositionY(block, 50);  engine.block.setWidth(block, 300);  engine.block.setHeight(block, 300);  engine.block.appendChild(page, block);
  engine.block.supportsEffects(scene); // Returns false  engine.block.supportsEffects(block); // Returns true
  const pixelize = engine.block.createEffect('pixelize');  const adjustments = engine.block.createEffect('adjustments');
  engine.block.appendEffect(block, pixelize);  engine.block.insertEffect(block, adjustments, 0);  // engine.block.removeEffect(rect, 0);
  // This will return [adjustments, pixelize]  const effectsList = engine.block.getEffects(block);
  const unusedEffect = engine.block.createEffect('half_tone');  engine.block.destroy(unusedEffect);
  const allPixelizeProperties = engine.block.findAllProperties(pixelize);  const allAdjustmentProperties = engine.block.findAllProperties(adjustments);  engine.block.setInt(pixelize, 'pixelize/horizontalPixelSize', 20);  engine.block.setFloat(adjustments, 'effect/adjustments/brightness', 0.2);
  engine.block.setEffectEnabled(pixelize, false);  engine.block.setEffectEnabled(    pixelize,    !engine.block.isEffectEnabled(pixelize),  );});
```

# Quick Actions

Custom quick actions are one-click editing functionalities, that either reuse existing functionalities or add new one and combine those into a simple workflow triggered by a user interactions as simple as a button click. There are multiple entry points where this quick action can be added.

## Quick Action: Background Removal[#](#quick-action-background-removal)

The background removal plugin is a great example of a one-click quick action. It allows you to remove the background of an image with a single click. After adding the plugin, you won’t see any immediate change to the editor. You will need to define where to place this feature.

```
import BackgroundRemovalPlugin from '@imgly/plugin-background-removal-web';
[...]
// Adding this plugin will automatically register user interface componentsawait cesdk.addPlugin(BackgroundRemovalPlugin());
// Prepend it to the canvas menu ...cesdk.ui.setCanvasMenuOrder([  'ly.img.background-removal.canvasMenu'  ...cesdk.ui.getCanvasMenuOrder(),]);
// ... or the inspector barcesdk.ui.setInspectorBar([  'ly.img.background-removal.inspectorBar'  ...cesdk.ui.getInspectorBar(),]);
```

## Quick Action: Vectorizer[#](#quick-action-vectorizer)

For the vectorizer plugin, the process is exactly the same. Simply install and add the plugin, then use the component Ids to extend the user interface.

```
import VectorizerPlugin from '@imgly/plugin-vectorizer-web';
[...]
// Adding this plugin will automatically register user interface componentsawait cesdk.addPlugin(VectorizerPlugin());
// Prepend it to the canvas menu ...cesdk.ui.setCanvasMenuOrder([  'ly.img.vectorizer.canvasMenu'  ...cesdk.ui.getCanvasMenuOrder(),]);
// ... or the inspector barcesdk.ui.setInspectorBar([  'ly.img.vectorizer.inspectorBar'  ...cesdk.ui.getInspectorBar(),]);
```

# Notifications and Dialogs

The CE.SDK editor brings notification and dialog APIs designed to deliver information to the user. Notifications convey non-intrusive information without disrupting the user’s current workflow. Dialogs are used to convey important information, warnings, or to request user input. They provide a range of customization options to fit your specific needs.

## Notifications[#](#notifications)

The CE.SDK editor notification API delivers messages appearing in the lower right corner of the user interface.

*   `cesdk.ui.showNotification(notification: string | Notification): string` displays a new notification to the user, accepting either a simple string message or a more complex notification object that allows for additional configuration options (detailed below). It returns an id of the notification.
*   `cesdk.ui.updateNotification(notificationId: string, notification: Notification): updates a notification given by the id. All configuration options can be changed. If the` notificationId\` doesn’t exist or the notification has already been dismissed, this action will have no effect.
*   `cesdk.ui.dismissNotification(notificationId: string)` removes a notification identified by the provided notification `notificationId`. If the `notificationId` doesn’t exist or the notification has already been dismissed, this action will have no effect.

### Notification Options[#](#notification-options)

All options apart from `message` are optional

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `message` | The message displayed on the notification. This can either be a string or an internationalization (i18n) key from the CE.SDK translations, allowing for localized messages. |
| `type` | Notifications can be displayed in various styles, each differing in appearance to convey the appropriate context to the user. The available types include `info` (which is the default setting), `warning`, `error`, `success`, and `loading` (which displays a loading spinner). |
| `duration` | Notifications typically disappear after a set period, but the duration can vary based on the message’s importance. Less critical updates may vanish swiftly, whereas warnings or significant alerts stay open for a longer time. You can specify this duration using either a numerical value representing milliseconds or predefined strings from CE.SDK, such as `short`, `medium` (which is the default setting), or `long`, each corresponding to different default durations. For notifications that should remain visible indefinitely, the `infinite` value can be used to prevent automatic dismissal. |
| `onDismiss` | A callback function that is triggered upon the dismissal of the notification, whether it’s done automatically, programmatically, or manually by the user. |
| `action: { label: "Retry", onClick: () => void }` | Adds a single action button within the notification for user interaction. |

### Example Code[#](#example-code)

```
CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk', config).then(async (cesdk) => {
  await cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();  await cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({ withUploadAssetSources: true });
  await cesdk.createDesignScene();
  cesdk.ui.showNotification("Welcome to our editor!");
  const notificationId = cesdk.ui.showNotification({    type: 'loading', message: 'Loading data...', duration: 'infinite'  });  setTimeout(() => {    cesdk.ui.updateNotification(notificationId, {      type: 'success', message: "Data loaded", duration: 'short'    });  }, 5000);
```

## Dialogs[#](#dialogs)

The dialog API provides methods to show, update, and close dialogs. Dialogs can be updated on the fly to reflect changes in the underlying data or to provide feedback to the user.

*   `cesdk.ui.showDialog(dialog: string | Dialog): string` displays a new dialog to the user, accepting either a simple string message or a more complex dialog object that allows for additional configuration options (detailed below). It returns an id of the dialog.
*   `cesdk.ui.updateDialog(dialogId: string, dialog: Dialog)` updates a dialog given by the id. All configuration options can be changed. If the `dialogId` doesn’t exist or the dialog has already been dismissed, this action will have no effect.
*   `cesdk.ui.closeDialog(dialogId: string)` removes a dialog identified by the provided dialog `dialogId`. If the `dialogId` doesn’t exist or the dialog has already been dismissed, this action will have no effect.

### Dialog Options[#](#dialog-options)

All options apart from `content` are optional. All strings can be internationalization (i18n) keys from the CE.SDK translations, allowing for localized messages.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | The type of dialog to display. The available types include `regular`, `success`, `error`, `info`, `warning`, and `loading`. The default type is `regular`. |
| `size` | The size of the dialog. The available sizes include `regular` and `large`. The default size is `regular`. |
| `content` | The content of the dialog. This can either be a `string` or an object with a `title` and `message` property. The `title` is optional. The `message` can be a string or an array of strings. |
| `progress` | The progress of the dialog. This can be a `number`, `indeterminate`, or an object with a `value` and `max` property. |
| `actions` | An array of action objects. Each action object must have a `label` and an `onClick` function. The `variant` and `color` properties are optional. The `variant` can be `regular` or `plain`. The `color` can be `accent` or `danger`. To remove all actions, you can provide an empty array `actions: []` |
| `cancel` | An action object that represents the cancel action. The structure is the same as for the `actions` property. |
| `onClose` | A callback function that is triggered when the dialog is closed. This can be used to perform cleanup operations or to trigger additional actions. |
| `clickOutsideToClose` | A boolean value that determines whether the dialog can be closed by clicking outside of it. The default value is `true`. |

### Code[#](#code)

```
CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk', config).then(async cesdk => {  await cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();  await cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({ withUploadAssetSources: true });
  await cesdk.createDesignScene();
  // Use the dialog API to show a simple dialog  const simpleDialogId = cesdk.ui.showDialog(    'This is a simple information Dialog',  );
  // Use the API to close the dialog  cesdk.ui.closeDialog(simpleDialogId);
  // Show a warning dialog  cesdk.ui.showDialog({    type: 'warning',    content: {      title: 'warning',      message: 'This is a warning dialog',    },    actions: [      { label: 'OK', onClick: context => cesdk.ui.closeDialog(context.id) },    ],    cancel: {      label: 'Cancel',      onClick: context => cesdk.ui.closeDialog(context.id),    },    onClose: () => console.log('Warning dialog closed'),  });
  // Show a simple loading dialog  cesdk.ui.showDialog({    type: 'loading',    content: 'loading...',    progress: 'indeterminate',    cancel: {      label: 'Cancel',      onClick: context => cesdk.ui.closeDialog(context.id),    },  });
  // Show a large loading dialog with a progress value  const largeProgressDialogId = cesdk.ui.showDialog({    type: 'loading',    content: {      title: 'Loading',      message: 'Loading data...',    },    progress: 0,    cancel: {      label: 'Cancel',      onClick: context => cesdk.ui.closeDialog(context.id),    },  });
  // Update the progress value of the large loading dialog  cesdk.ui.updateDialog(largeProgressDialogId, {    progress: 50,  });});
```

# Create a Custom Panel

Similar to registering [custom components](nextjs/user-interface/ui-extensions/register-new-component-b04a04/), the CE.SDK web editor allows you to render custom panels. Built-in UI elements ensure that your custom panel blends seamlessly with the editor’s look and feel, while still enabling you to adapt the editor to your unique workflows.

```
registerPanel(panelId: string, renderFunction: ({ builder, engine, state }) => void)
```

Registers a panel whose content can be rendered with a panel builder, similar to how custom components are registered.

The builder’s render function is called with three arguments: the builder, the engine, and the state. The builder object is used to define which base components (such as buttons) should be rendered. The engine is used to retrieve any state from the engine. The render function will be called again if any engine-related state changes occur due to engine calls or the local state was updated.

*   `panelId`: The unique ID of the new registered panel.
*   `renderFunction`: The render function of the panel.

## When is a Panel Rendered?[#](#when-is-a-panel-rendered)

It is important concept to understand when a panel re-renders after its initial rendering. The component assumes that all its state is stored in the `engine` or the local state. Whenever we detect a change that is relevant for this panel it will re-render.

### Using the Engine[#](#using-the-engine)

Inside the render function, any calls that retrieve values from the engine will be tracked. If a change is detected, the render function will be automatically re-called.

For example, in a panel, we could query for all selected blocks and decide whether to render a button based on the result. The engine detects the call to findAllSelected and knows that if the selection changes, it needs to re-render the panel. This behavior applies to all methods provided by the engine.

### Using Local State[#](#using-local-state)

Besides the `engine`, the render function also receives a `state` argument to manage local state. This can be used to control input components or store state in general. When the state changes, the panel will be re-rendered as well.

The `state` argument is a function that is called with a unique ID for the state. Any subsequent call to the state within this panel will return the same state. The second optional argument is the default value for this state. If the state has not been set yet, it will return this value. Without this argument, you’ll need to handle `undefined` values manually.

The return value of the state call is an object with `value` and `setValue` properties, which can be used to get and set the state. Since these property names match those used by input components, the object can be directly spread into the component options.

```
cesdk.ui.registerPanel('counter', ({ builder, state }) => {  const urlState = state('url', '');  const { value, setValue } = state('counter', 0);
  builder.Section('counter', {    children: () => {      builder.TextInput('text-input-1', {        inputLabel: 'TextInput 1',        ...urlState      });
      builder.Button('submit-button', {        label: 'Submit',        onClick: () => {          const pressed = value + 1;          setValue(pressed);          console.log(            `Pressed ${pressed} times with the current URL ${urlState.value}`          );        }      });    }  });});
```

## Integrate the Panel into the Editor[#](#integrate-the-panel-into-the-editor)

After registering a component, it is not automatically opened or integrated in any other way. The CE.SDK editor is just aware that there is a panel with this id.

### Opening a Panel[#](#opening-a-panel)

Once a panel is registered, it can be controlled using the [Panel API](nextjs/user-interface/customization/panel-7ce1ee/), just like any other panel. For instance, you can open a custom panel with `cesdk.ui.openPanel(registeredPanelId)`. Other settings, such as position and floating, can also be adjusted accordingly. The payload passed by `openPanel` is also accessible within the panel’s render function.

In most cases, you will want to open it using a custom button, .e.g in a button inside the [Dock](nextjs/user-interface/customization/dock-cb916c/) or [Inspector Bar](nextjs/user-interface/customization/inspector-bar-8ca1cd/).

### Setting the Title of a Custom Panel[#](#setting-the-title-of-a-custom-panel)

The title of a panel is determined by a translation based on the panel’s ID. For example, if the panel ID is `myCustomPanel`, the corresponding translation key would be `panel.myCustomPanel`.

```
cesdk.i18n.setTranslations({  en: {    'panel.myCustomPanel': 'My Custom Panel',  },  de: {    'panel.myCustomPanel': 'Mein eigenes Panel',  }});
```

## Using the Builder[#](#using-the-builder)

The `builder` object passed to the render function provides a set of methods to create UI elements. Calling this method will add a builder component to the user interface. This includes buttons, dropdowns, text, etc.

## Builder Components[#](#builder-components)

The following builder components can be used inside a registered panel.

# Add a New Button

Customization not only includes changing the existing behavior but also extends to adding new features tailored to your needs. This guide will show you how to add new buttons to different locations within the web editor.

## Adding a Document Button to the Dock[#](#adding-a-document-button-to-the-dock)

In our default configuration of the web editor, we only show dock buttons that open asset libraries. In this example, we want to extend that functionality by adding a button that opens the document inspector.

In the default view of the web editor, the inspector panel is not always visible. Additionally, the document inspector only appears if no block is selected. If your use case requires a simple user interface with just the inspector bar and an easy way for the customer to access the document inspector, we can now add a custom button to achieve this.

First, we need to register a new component. This component will check if the document inspector is already open. To open it, we will deselect all blocks and use the [Panel API](nextjs/user-interface/customization/panel-7ce1ee/) to open the inspector panel.

```
cesdk.ui.registerComponent(  'document.dock',  ({ builder: { Button }, engine }) => {    const inspectorOpen = cesdk.ui.isPanelOpen('//ly.img.panel/inspector');
    Button('open-document', {      label: 'Document',      // Using the open state to mark the button as selected      isSelected: inspectorOpen,      onClick: () => {        // Deselect all blocks to enable the document inspector        engine.block.findAllSelected().forEach(blockId => {          engine.block.setSelected(blockId, false);        });
        if (inspectorOpen) {          cesdk.ui.closePanel('//ly.img.panel/inspector');        } else {          cesdk.ui.openPanel('//ly.img.panel/inspector');        }      },    });  },);
```

That is all for the component for now. What is left to do is to add this component to the dock order.

```
cesdk.ui.setDockOrder([  ...cesdk.ui.getDockOrder(),  // We add a spacer to push the document inspector button to the bottom  'ly.img.spacer',  // The id of the component we registered earlier  'document.dock',]);
```

## Add a Button to the Canvas Menu to Mark Blocks[#](#add-a-button-to-the-canvas-menu-to-mark-blocks)

In our next example, we aim to establish a workflow where a designer can review a design and mark blocks that need to be reviewed by another designer. We will define a field in the metadata for this purpose and add a button to the canvas menu that toggles this marker.

Once again, we start by registering a new component.

```
cesdk.ui.registerComponent(  'marker.canvasMenu',  ({ builder: { Button }, engine }) => {    const selectedBlockIds = engine.block.findAllSelected();    // Only show the button if exactly one block is selected    if (selectedBlockIds.length !== 1) return;
    const selectedBlockId = selectedBlockIds[0];
    // Check if the block is already marked    const isMarked = engine.block.hasMetadata(selectedBlockId, 'marker');
    Button('marker-button', {      label: isMarked ? 'Unmark' : 'Mark',      // Change the color if the block is marked to indicate the state      color: isMarked ? 'accent' : undefined,      onClick: () => {        if (isMarked) {          engine.block.removeMetadata(selectedBlockId, 'marker');        } else {          // Metadata is a simple key-value store. We do not care about the          // actual value but only if it was set.          engine.block.setMetadata(selectedBlockId, 'marker', 'marked');        }      },    });  },);
```

Now, instead of appending this button, we want to put it at the beginning as this needs to be a prominent feature.

```
cesdk.ui.setCanvasMenuOrder([  'marker.canvasMenu',  ...cesdk.ui.getCanvasMenuOrder(),]);
```

# Add a Custom Feature

Creating your own plugin can be useful for your integration if you want to bundle features together or even publish them for others to use.

**Do I Need to Create a Plugin to Customize the Editor?**

Short answer: No. Keep in mind that you neither have to create a plugin to customize the CE.SDK, nor do you have to publish it. Feel free to use all APIs directly after initializing the CE.SDK. This is completely fine. Even if you decide to bundle everything into a plugin, you can still keep it private and use it only for your own integration.

## Create a Plugin[#](#create-a-plugin)

Plugins are added to the editor using the `addPlugin` method. This method takes a plugin object that needs to provide specific properties and methods.

The most important method is `initialize`, which is called when the plugin is added to the editor. It will receive the current execution context as an argument. If the plugin is added only to the engine, the `cesdk` argument will be undefined. This allows you to write plugins that can be used for both the engine and the editor.

You can pass this `MyPlugin` object directly to the `addPlugin` method. If you plan to publish your plugin in private or public repositories, this object is what should be exported.

However, most plugins will need some kind of configuration. If you expose a plugin, it is a good convention to export a function that returns the plugin object and accepts a config object as an argument. Even if you don’t need any configuration yet, it is recommended to use this pattern to avoid breaking user code in the future once you introduce an optional configuration.

```
const MyPlugin = () => ({  name: 'MyPlugin',  version: '1.0.0',  initialize: ({    // This argument is only defined if the plugin is added to the editor.    // If you call the `addPlugin` method on the engine, this argument will be undefined.    cesdk,    // The engine is always defined    engine,  }) => {    // Your plugin code here  },});
await cesdk.addPlugin(MyPlugin());
```

## Initialization of a Plugin[#](#initialization-of-a-plugin)

What is supposed to be done in the `initialize` method of a plugin? There are no enforced rules, but some conventions are recommended, especially if you plan to publish your plugin in any way.

Adding a plugin will call the `initialize` method of the plugin object directly. The purpose of this method is to register components, and features, or subscribe to events and changes of blocks. It is not supposed to immediately execute any action or make changes to the editor.

This includes changing the order of any location, such as adding a new component to it. The integrator of the plugin needs to decide when to add which component and where. If the plugin wants to add a shortcut for that, the default locations can be optionally set via the plugin configuration.

```
const MyPlugin = ({ ui: { locations } }) => ({  name: 'MyPlugin',  version: '1.0.0',  initialize: ({ cesdk, engine }) => {    // Register a new components    cesdk.ui.registerComponent('myComponent.canvasMenu', [...]);    cesdk.ui.registerComponent('myComponent.inspectorBar', [...]);
    // Register a new feature    cesdk.feature.enable('myFeature', true);
    // Subscribe to events or similar    // [...]
    if (locations.includes('canvasMenu') {      cesdk.ui.setCanvasMenuOrder(['myComponent.canvasMenu', ...cesdk.ui.getCanvasMenuOrder()]);    }    if (locations.includes('inspectorBar') {      cesdk.ui.setInspectorBarOrder(['myComponent.inspectorBar', ...cesdk.ui.getInspectorBarOrder()]);    }  }});
```

# Register a New Component

The CE.SDK web editor provides a set of built-in components that you can reference and render in a specific order. You can see a list of all available components in the respective documentation, including [Dock](nextjs/user-interface/customization/dock-cb916c/), [Canvas Menu](nextjs/user-interface/customization/canvas-menu-0d2b5b/), [Inspector Bar](nextjs/user-interface/customization/inspector-bar-8ca1cd/), [Navigation Bar](nextjs/user-interface/customization/navigation-bar-4e5d39/) and [Canvas Bar](nextjs/user-interface/customization/canvas-632c8e/).

Additionally, you can write your own custom components, register them, and use them just like the built-in components. This allows you to extend the functionality of the CE.SDK web editor with custom logic and create a more personalized experience for your users.

## Registering a Custom Component[#](#registering-a-custom-component)

The entry point for writing a custom component is the method `registerComponent`. For a given identifier, you add a function that will be called repeatedly to render this component. Several arguments are passed to this function that can be used to access the current state of the `engine` and render an UI with the help of the `builder`.

```
cesdk.ui.registerComponent(  'myCustomComponent',  ({ builder: { Button }, engine }) => {    const selectedIds = engine.block.findAllSelected();
    if (selectedIds.length !== 1) return;
    Button('button-id', {      label: 'My Button',      onClick: () => {        console.log('Button clicked');      },    });  },);
```

### When is a Component Rendered?[#](#when-is-a-component-rendered)

It is important concept to understand when a registered component re-renders after its initial rendering. The component assumes that all its state is stored in the `engine` or the local state. Whenever we detect a change that is relevant for this component it will re-render.

### Using the Engine[#](#using-the-engine)

In the above example, we query for all selected blocks and based on the result we render a button or not. The engine detects the call to `findAllSelected` and now knows that if the selection changes, it needs to re-render this component. This works with all methods provided by the engine.

### Using Local State[#](#using-local-state)

Besides the `engine`, the render function also receives a `state` argument to manage local state. This can be used to control input components or store state in general. When the state changes, the component will be re-rendered as well.

The `state` argument is a function that is called with a unique ID for the state. Any subsequent call to the state within this registered component will return the same state. The second optional argument is the default value for this state. If the state has not been set yet, it will return this value. Without this argument, you’ll need to handle `undefined` values manually.

The return value of the state call is an object with `value` and `setValue` properties, which can be used to get and set the state. Since these property names match those used by input components, the object can be directly spread into the component options.

```
cesdk.ui.registerComponent('counter', ({ builder, state }) => {  const { value, setValue } = state('counter', 0);
  builder.Button('counter-button', {    label: `${value} clicks`,    onClick: () => {      const pressed = value + 1;      setValue(pressed);    }  });});
```

## Passing Data to a Custom Component[#](#passing-data-to-a-custom-component)

If you add a component to an order, you can either pass a string representing the component or an object with the id and additional data. This data can be accessed in the component function with inside the `payload` property.

```
cesdk.ui.registerComponent(  'myDockEnry.dock',  ({ builder: { Button }, engine, payload }) => {    const { label } = payload;    console.log('Label', label);  },);
cesdk.ui.setDockOrder([  {    id: 'myDockEnry.dock',    label: 'Custom Label',  },]);
```

## Using the Builder[#](#using-the-builder)

The `builder` object passed to the render function provides a set of methods to create UI elements. Calling this method will add a builder component to the user interface. This includes buttons, dropdowns, text, etc.

### Available Builder components[#](#available-builder-components)

Not every location supports every builder component yet. It will be extended over time. If you are unsure, you can always check the documentation of the respective component.

| Builder Component | Description | Properties | Available For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `builder.Button` | A simple button to react on a user click. | **label**: The label inside the button. If it is a i18n key, it will be used for translation.

\- If 2 or more separators end up next to each other (e.g. due to other components not rendering), **only 1** separator will be rendered.  
\- Separators that end up being the first or last element in the canvas menu will **not** be rendered.  
\- Separators directly adjacent _to the top side_ of a spacer (see below) will **not** be rendered. | \- | [Dock](nextjs/user-interface/customization/dock-cb916c/), [Canvas Menu](nextjs/user-interface/customization/canvas-menu-0d2b5b/), [Inspector Bar](nextjs/user-interface/customization/inspector-bar-8ca1cd/), [Navigation Bar](nextjs/user-interface/customization/navigation-bar-4e5d39/) and [Canvas Bar](nextjs/user-interface/customization/canvas-632c8e/) |

# Save and Export Buttons

This guide shows how to add save and export action buttons to your CE.SDK navigation bar using the Navigation Bar Order API.

## Quick Start[#](#quick-start)

Add save and export buttons to your navigation bar:

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from '@cesdk/cesdk-js';
const cesdk = await CreativeEditorSDK.create(container, {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',});
// Add save and export buttonscesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: [    'ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar', // Save scene    'ly.img.exportImage.navigationBar', // Export as image    'ly.img.exportPDF.navigationBar', // Export as PDF  ],});
```

## Save Button[#](#save-button)

The save button (`ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar`) persists the current scene state. You can use the default behavior or customize it.

### Default Behavior[#](#default-behavior)

```
// Adds a save button that downloads the scene filecesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: ['ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar'],});
```

### Custom Save with Notification[#](#custom-save-with-notification)

```
// Register custom save callbackcesdk.actions.register('saveScene', async () => {  const scene = await cesdk.engine.scene.saveToString();  await cesdk.utils.downloadFile(scene, 'text/plain;charset=UTF-8');  cesdk.ui.showNotification('Scene saved successfully');});
// Add save button that uses registered callbackcesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: ['ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar'],});
```

### Save to Backend[#](#save-to-backend)

```
// Register save callback that uploads to backendcesdk.actions.register('saveScene', async () => {  const scene = await cesdk.engine.scene.saveToString();
  try {    console.log('Scene ready to save:', scene.length, 'characters');
    // Production:    // const { id } = await saveProjectToBackend(scene);    // cesdk.ui.showNotification(`Saved (ID: ${id})`);
    cesdk.ui.showNotification('Scene saved successfully');  } catch (error) {    cesdk.ui.showNotification('Save failed', 'error');  }});
// Add save button that uses registered callbackcesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: ['ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar'],});
```

## Export Buttons[#](#export-buttons)

Export buttons convert your design to different output formats. CE.SDK provides three default export buttons that all trigger the `exportDesign` callback with different MIME types:

*   **Image Export** (`ly.img.exportImage.navigationBar`) - passes `{ mimeType: 'image/png' }`
*   **PDF Export** (`ly.img.exportPDF.navigationBar`) - passes `{ mimeType: 'application/pdf' }`
*   **Video Export** (`ly.img.exportVideo.navigationBar`) - passes `{ mimeType: 'video/mp4' }`

The `exportDesign` callback receives the export options including the MIME type, allowing you to handle different export formats appropriately.

### Image Export[#](#image-export)

The image export button (`ly.img.exportImage.navigationBar`) exports the design as PNG.

#### Default Behavior (Download)[#](#default-behavior-download)

Using just the string ID will download the exported PNG file to the user’s device:

```
// Default behavior: downloads PNG to user's devicecesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: ['ly.img.exportImage.navigationBar'],});
```

#### Upload to CDN[#](#upload-to-cdn)

```
// Register export callback that uploads to CDNcesdk.actions.register('exportDesign', async options => {  // The options will include { mimeType: 'image/png' } from the button  const { blobs } = await cesdk.utils.export({    pngCompressionLevel: 7,    ...options, // This already contains mimeType: 'image/png'  });
  console.log('Image ready for upload:', blobs[0].size, 'bytes');
  // Production:  // const url = await uploadToCDN(blobs[0]);
  cesdk.ui.showNotification('Image uploaded successfully');});
// Add export button that uses registered callbackcesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: ['ly.img.exportImage.navigationBar'],});
```

### PDF Export[#](#pdf-export)

The PDF export button (`ly.img.exportPDF.navigationBar`) exports all pages as a PDF.

#### Default Behavior (Download)[#](#default-behavior-download-1)

Using just the string ID will download the PDF file to the user’s device:

```
// Default behavior: downloads PDF to user's devicecesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: ['ly.img.exportPDF.navigationBar'],});
```

#### Upload to CDN[#](#upload-to-cdn-1)

```
// Register export callback that uploads PDFs to CDNcesdk.actions.register('exportDesign', async options => {  // The options will include { mimeType: 'application/pdf' } from the button  const { blobs } = await cesdk.utils.export({    targetDPI: 300,    ...options, // This already contains mimeType: 'application/pdf'  });
  console.log('PDF ready for upload:', blobs[0].size, 'bytes');
  // Production:  // const url = await uploadToCDN(blobs[0]);
  cesdk.ui.showNotification('PDF uploaded successfully');});
// Add export button that uses registered callbackcesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: ['ly.img.exportPDF.navigationBar'],});
```

### Video Export[#](#video-export)

The video export button (`ly.img.exportVideo.navigationBar`) exports animations as MP4.

#### Default Behavior (Download)[#](#default-behavior-download-2)

Using just the string ID will download the MP4 file to the user’s device:

```
// Default behavior: downloads MP4 to user's devicecesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: ['ly.img.exportVideo.navigationBar'],});
```

#### Upload to CDN[#](#upload-to-cdn-2)

```
// Register video export callback that uploads to CDNcesdk.actions.register('exportDesign', async options => {  // The options will include { mimeType: 'video/mp4' } from the button  // Export video (utils.export handles its own loading dialog)  const { blobs } = await cesdk.utils.export({    framerate: 30,    ...options, // This already contains mimeType: 'video/mp4'  });
  console.log('Video ready for upload:', blobs[0].size, 'bytes');
  // Production:  // const url = await uploadToCDN(blobs[0]);
  cesdk.ui.showNotification('Video uploaded successfully');});
// Add export button that uses registered callbackcesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: ['ly.img.exportVideo.navigationBar'],});
```

## Handling Multiple Export Types[#](#handling-multiple-export-types)

Since all export buttons trigger the same `exportDesign` callback with different MIME types, you can handle multiple export formats in a single callback:

```
// Register a unified export handler for all formatscesdk.actions.register('exportDesign', async exportOptions => {  // The cesdk.utils.export automatically adapts based on the MIME type  const { blobs, options } = await cesdk.utils.export(exportOptions);
  // Handle different formats using the returned options  if (options.mimeType?.startsWith('video/')) {    console.log('Video ready:', blobs[0].size, 'bytes');
    // Production:    // await uploadVideoToCDN(blobs[0]);
    cesdk.ui.showNotification('Video uploaded successfully');  } else if (options.mimeType === 'application/pdf') {    console.log('PDF ready:', blobs[0].size, 'bytes');
    // Production:    // await uploadPDFToStorage(blobs[0]);
    cesdk.ui.showNotification('PDF saved to storage');  } else {    console.log('Image ready:', blobs[0].size, 'bytes');
    // Production:    // await uploadImageToCDN(blobs[0]);
    cesdk.ui.showNotification('Image uploaded successfully');  }});
// Add all export buttons - they'll all use the same callbackcesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: [    'ly.img.exportImage.navigationBar', // Passes { mimeType: 'image/png' }    'ly.img.exportPDF.navigationBar', // Passes { mimeType: 'application/pdf' }    'ly.img.exportVideo.navigationBar', // Passes { mimeType: 'video/mp4' }  ],});
```

## Custom Export with Loading Dialogs[#](#custom-export-with-loading-dialogs)

When using the engine APIs directly instead of `cesdk.utils.export`, you need to:

1.  Create your own loading dialog using `cesdk.utils.showLoadingDialog`
2.  Handle the export type detection yourself based on the MIME type
3.  Manage progress updates manually

### Complete Custom Export Implementation[#](#complete-custom-export-implementation)

Use the engine API directly when you need fine-grained control over the export process. This example shows how to handle all export types (image, PDF, video) using only engine APIs:

```
// Register custom export using only engine APIs for full controlcesdk.actions.register('exportDesign', async options => {  // Create loading dialog for all export types  const dialogController = cesdk.utils.showLoadingDialog({    title: 'Exporting',    message: 'Processing your design...',    progress: 'indeterminate',    abortLabel: 'Cancel',    onAbort: () => console.log('Export cancelled'),  });
  try {    const page = cesdk.engine.scene.getCurrentPage();    if (page === null) {      throw new Error('No page selected for export');    }
    let blob;
    // Handle different export types with engine APIs    if (options?.mimeType?.startsWith('video/')) {      // Video export with progress      blob = await cesdk.engine.block.exportVideo(page, {        mimeType: options.mimeType,        targetWidth: 1920,        targetHeight: 1080,        framerate: 30,        onProgress: (rendered, encoded, total) => {          dialogController.updateProgress({            value: rendered,            max: total,          });        },      });    } else {      // Static export (image, PDF)      blob = await cesdk.engine.block.export(page, {        mimeType: options?.mimeType || 'image/png',        pngCompressionLevel: 7,        targetWidth: 1920,        targetHeight: 1080,      });    }
    console.log('Export ready:', blob.size, 'bytes');
    // Production:    // const url = await uploadToCDN(blob);    // await navigator.clipboard.writeText(url);
    // Show success    dialogController.showSuccess({      message: 'Export successful',    });  } catch (error) {    // Show error    dialogController.showError({      message: 'Export failed. Please try again.',    });  }});
// Add export button that uses registered callbackcesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: ['ly.img.exportImage.navigationBar'],});
```

# Rearrange Buttons

The CE.SDK web editor is carefully designed with a good user experience in mind. However, sometimes these decisions do not apply to your use case, and you might want to move the buttons around to suit your needs better. This guide will show you how to do that.

## Rearranging the Navigation Bar[#](#rearranging-the-navigation-bar)

A common request is to change the order of the buttons in the navigation bar. Let’s say you want to place your Call To Action buttons to save/export your content at the beginning of the navigation bar instead of at the end. Additionally, let’s say that the undo/redo buttons should be placed beside the zoom controls on the right side of the navigation bar. And because we do not want to show a preview in this particular use case, it will be removed as well.

Let us take a look at the default navigation bar:

```
cesdk.ui.getNavigationBarOrder();// => [//    'ly.img.back.navigationBar',//    'ly.img.undoControls.navigationBar',//    'ly.img.spacer',//    'ly.img.title.navigationBar',//    'ly.img.spacer',//    'ly.img.zoom.navigationBar',//    'ly.img.preview.navigationBar',//    'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',//    'ly.img.close.navigationBar'//  ]
```

Since we do not care about the back and close buttons, as well as the title, we will set it to the following order with this result:

![Rearranged Navigation Bar](/docs/cesdk/_astro/rearrangedNavigationbar.DZFubBIp_ZsQUoD.webp)

```
cesdk.ui.setNavigationBarOrder([  'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  'ly.img.spacer',  'ly.img.zoom.navigationBar',  'ly.img.undoRedo.navigationBar',]);
```

## Rearranging the Navigation Bar actions[#](#rearranging-the-navigation-bar-actions)

Similar to how the `setNavigationBarOrder` allows rearranging the elements on the top level, you can use the same API to rearrange the actions of the actions dropdown.

```
cesdk.ui.setNavigationBarOrder([  'ly.img.undoRedo.navigationBar',  'ly.img.spacer',  'ly.img.zoom.navigationBar',  {    id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',    children: [      'ly.img.exportImage.navigationBar',      'ly.img.exportPDF.navigationBar',      'ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar',      'ly.img.importScene.navigationBar',    ],  },]);
```

This will result in the following order of the actions dropdown: ![Rearranged Navigation Bar Actions](/docs/cesdk/_astro/rearrange-actions.CI-vjjSZ_1IBr81.webp)

## Reducing the Canvas Menu[#](#reducing-the-canvas-menu)

The canvas menu is a prominent element during the design. In some cases you want to keep it as minimalistic as possible with only the two most important actions in it: Duplicate and Delete. When trying to move existing buttons, it is always a good idea to check the default order first (or take a look at the [Canvas Menu documentation](nextjs/user-interface/customization/canvas-menu-0d2b5b/)).

```
cesdk.ui.getCanvasMenuOrder();// => [//  'ly.img.group.enter.canvasMenu',//  'ly.img.group.select.canvasMenu',////  'ly.img.movePage.up.canvasMenu',//  'ly.img.movePage.down.canvasMenu',////  'ly.img.separator',////  'ly.img.editText.canvasMenu',//  'ly.img.replace.canvasMenu',////  'ly.img.separator',////  'ly.img.placeholder.canvasMenu',////  'ly.img.separator',////  'ly.img.duplicate.canvasMenu',//  'ly.img.delete.canvasMenu'//  ]
```

There is already a lot more going on in the canvas menu compared to the navigation bar, but we can spot the components for duplicate and delete at the end of the order. Now we can just set the order to these two buttons:

```
cesdk.ui.setCanvasMenuOrder([  'ly.img.duplicate.canvasMenu',  'ly.img.delete.canvasMenu',]);
```

## Rearranging the Dock[#](#rearranging-the-dock)

The dock is the area where the user will look for assets to add to the scene. In our default implementation, we show a button to design templates first, followed by the assets like images, stickers, etc.

However, for this integration, we do not want the user to focus on the templates first. Instead, the decision was made to move it to the end of the dock. For even more focus on the assets, we will not only append the templates but also push them to the edge of the dock with the help of a spacer.

```
cesdk.ui.getDock();// => [//     {//         "id": "ly.img.assetLibrary.dock",//         "key": "ly.img.template",//         "icon": "@imgly/Template",//         "label": "libraries.ly.img.template.label",//         "entries": [//             "ly.img.template"//         ]//     },//     {//         "id": "ly.img.assetLibrary.dock",//         "key": "ly.img.video.template",//         "icon": "@imgly/Template",//         "label": "libraries.ly.img.video.template.label",//         "entries": [//             "ly.img.video.template"//         ]//     },//     {//         "id": "ly.img.separator"//     },//     {//         "id": "ly.img.assetLibrary.dock",//         "key": "ly.img.elements",//         "icon": "@imgly/Library",//         "label": "component.library.elements",//         "entries": [//             "ly.img.upload",//             "ly.img.video",//             "ly.img.audio",//             "ly.img.image",//             "ly.img.text",//             "ly.img.vectorpath",//             "ly.img.sticker",//             "cutout-entry"//         ]//     },//     [...]//     A lot more entries we do not care about right now//     [...]// ]
```

Let’s pull the first two components to the end of the dock with a spacer element before them:

```
setDockOrder([  {    id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock',    key: 'ly.img.elements',    icon: '@imgly/Library',    label: 'component.library.elements',    entries: [      'ly.img.upload',      'ly.img.video',      'ly.img.audio',      'ly.img.image',      'ly.img.text',      'ly.img.vectorpath',      'ly.img.sticker',      'cutout-entry',    ],  },  //    [...]  //    A lot more entries we do not care about right now  //    [...]  'ly.img.spacer',  {    id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock',    key: 'ly.img.template',    icon: '@imgly/Template',    label: 'libraries.ly.img.template.label',    entries: ['ly.img.template'],  },  {    id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock',    key: 'ly.img.video.template',    icon: '@imgly/Template',    label: 'libraries.ly.img.video.template.label',    entries: ['ly.img.video.template'],  },]);
```

# Panel

Panels are a basic concept of our UI, e.g. extensively used for asset libraries and inspectors.

## Show or Hide Panels[#](#show-or-hide-panels)

*   ~`inspector.position: string`~ **Deprecated**: Use `cesdk.ui.setPanelPosition('//ly.img.panel/inspector', position)` instead.
*   ~`inspector.show: boolean`~ **Deprecated**: Use `cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.inspector', () => boolean)` instead.
*   ~`inspector.floating: boolean`~ **Deprecated**: Use `cesdk.ui.setPanelFloating('//ly.img.panel/inspector', floating)` instead.
*   ~`assetLibrary.position: string`~ **Deprecated**: Use `cesdk.ui.setPanelPosition('//ly.img.panel/assetLibrary', position)` instead.
*   ~`assetLibrary.show: boolean`~ **Deprecated**: Use `cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.library.panel', () => boolean)` instead.
*   ~`settings: boolean`~ **Deprecated**: Use `cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.settings', () => boolean)` instead.

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',  userId: 'guides-user',  ui: {    elements: {      /* ... */      navigation: {        /* ... */      },      dock: {        /* ... */      },      libraries: {        /* ... */      },      blocks: {        /* ... */      },    },  },};
CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk_container', config).then(async cesdk => {  // Configure panels using Feature API and Panel API  cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.inspector', () => true);  cesdk.ui.setPanelPosition('//ly.img.panel/inspector', 'left');  cesdk.ui.setPanelFloating('//ly.img.panel/inspector', false);
  cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.library.panel', () => true);  cesdk.ui.setPanelPosition('//ly.img.panel/assetLibrary', 'left');
  cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.settings', () => true);
  // Set the editor view mode  cesdk.ui.setView('default');
  // Do something with the instance of CreativeEditor SDK, for example:  // Populate the asset library with default / demo asset sources.  cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();  cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({    sceneMode: 'Design',    withUploadAssetSources: true,  });  await cesdk.createDesignScene();});
```

## Configure Libraries[#](#configure-libraries)

*   `insert.floating: boolean` _(deprecated)_ configures if the asset library panel is floating over the canvas or set aside of it. Use `cesdk.ui.setPanelFloating()` instead.
*   `insert.autoClose: boolean | () => boolean` configures if the asset library panel is closed after an asset was inserted (default is `false`).
*   `replace.floating: boolean` _(deprecated)_ configures if the image replacement library panel is floating over the canvas or set aside of it. Use `cesdk.ui.setPanelFloating()` instead.
*   `replace.autoClose: boolean | () => boolean` configures if the asset library panel is closed after an asset was replaced (default is `true`).

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',  userId: 'guides-user',  ui: {    elements: {      /* ... */      navigation: {        /* ... */      },      dock: {        /* ... */      },      libraries: {        insert: {          autoClose: false, // true or false        },        replace: {          autoClose: false, // true or false        },      },      blocks: {        /* ... */      },    },  },};
CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk_container', config).then(async cesdk => {  // Enable panels using Feature API (if needed)  cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.library.panel', () => true);
  // Configure panel floating behavior using API  cesdk.ui.setPanelFloating('//ly.img.panel/assetLibrary', true);  cesdk.ui.setPanelFloating('//ly.img.panel/replaceAssetLibrary', true);
  // Set the editor view mode  cesdk.ui.setView('default');
  // Do something with the instance of CreativeEditor SDK, for example:  // Populate the asset library with default / demo asset sources.  cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();  cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({    sceneMode: 'Design',    withUploadAssetSources: true,  });  await cesdk.createDesignScene();});
```

## API[#](#api)

Given a CreativeEditorSDK instance, we can query if a given panel is open as well as access methods to open/close them.

*   `cesdk.ui.isPanelOpen(panelId: string, options?: { position?: PanelPosition, floating?: boolean }): boolean` returns `true` if a panel with the given panel id is open. If options are provided they will be matched against the panel’s options. E.g. `isPanelOpen('//ly.img.panel/assetLibrary', { floating: false })` will only return true if the asset library is open as a floating panel.
    
*   `cesdk.ui.openPanel(panelId: string, options?: { position?: PanelPosition, floating?: boolean, closableByUser?: boolean, payload?: PanelPayload })` opens a panel with the given id if and only if it exists, is not open and is currently registered (known to the UI). Otherwise the method does nothing and is a noop.
    
    Options can be provided additionally that will override the default position and floating of the given panel. (Please note, that the default position and floating behavior are not changed for this panel.) In addition, the `closableByUser` option can control if the panel can be closed by the user. Finally, the payload option is passed to the opened registered panel, where it can be accessed. For example, when the panel `//ly.img.panel/assetLibrary` is opened, it expects a payload of type `{title?: string | string[], entries?: string[]}`. This payload determines the panel’s title and content, such as the asset library entries displayed in the panel.
    
*   `cesdk.ui.closePanel(panelId: string)` closes panels matching the given ID or wildcard pattern. Supports exact matching (e.g., `'//ly.img.panel/inspector'`) or wildcard patterns e.g., `'//ly.img.panel*'` to close all ly.img panels.
    

### Panel Position[#](#panel-position)

Every panel in the UI is typically displayed either on the left or right side of the canvas. An exception exists for rendering in [smaller viewports](nextjs/user-interface/overview-41101a/), where all panels are situated at the bottom.

The setPanelPosition API is used to determine a panel’s default placement.

*   `cesdk.ui.setPanelPosition(panelId: string, panelPosition: PanelPosition)` assigns a specific position to a panel identified by `panelId`. This function will also alter the panel’s position while it is open, provided the panel wasn’t initially opened with a pre-defined position option (see above).

### Floating Panel[#](#floating-panel)

Panels can either float over the canvas, potentially obscuring content, or be positioned adjacent to the canvas. The setPanelFloating API allows you to modify this behavior to suit different use cases.

*   `cesdk.ui.setPanelFloating(panelId: string, floating: boolean)` when set to true, the specified panel will float above the canvas. Conversely, setting it to false places the panel beside the canvas.

### Available Panels[#](#available-panels)

By default, CE.SDK provides several different panels for user interaction. Additional panels can be added by the user or through plugins. The findAllPanels function helps retrieve the current panels and filter them based on their state.

*   `cesdk.ui.findAllPanels(options?: { open?: boolean, position?: PanelPosition, floating?: boolean }): string[]` returns all panel ids. If options are provided they will be matched against the panel’s options. E.g. `findAllPanels({ open: true })` will only return panel ids of currently open panels.

Some important panels that are registered by default are:

| Panel Id | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `//ly.img.panel/inspector` | The inspector panel for the currently selected block. Please note, that if no block is selected at all, this will open an empty panel with no content. In the advanced view, inspector panels are always open and cannot be opened/closed. |
| `//ly.img.panel/assetLibrary` | The panel for the asset library, Please note, that currently it is not possible to open a new asset library with library entries defined. Thus, opening an asset library would show an empty library. More useful is `closePanel` to close an already open asset library. |
| `//ly.img.panel/assetLibrary.replace` | The panel containing the replace library for the currently selected block. Please note, that if no block is selected or the selected block does not have asset replacement configured, the opened library will be empty. See [Custom Asset Library](nextjs/import-media/asset-panel/customize-c9a4de/) for more information. |
| `//ly.img.panel/settings` | The settings panel to customize the editor during runtime. |

### Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here is the full code:

```
CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk', config).then(async cesdk => {  await cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();  await cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({ withUploadAssetSources: true });
  // The inspector should be rendered on the left as a non-floating panel  cesdk.ui.setPanelPosition('//ly.img.panel/inspector', 'left');  cesdk.ui.setPanelFloating('//ly.img.panel/inspector', false);
  await cesdk.createDesignScene();
  // Adding some image after creating the scene  const image = await cesdk.engine.asset.defaultApplyAsset({    id: 'ly.img.cesdk.images.samples/sample.1',    meta: {      uri: 'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v1/ly.img.image/images/sample_1.jpg',      width: 2500,      height: 1667,    },  });
  if (image == null) return;
  // Select the first image after loading the scene ...  cesdk.engine.block.setSelected(image, true);
  // ... and opening the replace asset library for the user to choose a differnt image  if (!cesdk.ui.isPanelOpen('//ly.img.panel/assetLibrary.replace')) {    cesdk.ui.openPanel('//ly.img.panel/assetLibrary.replace');  }
  // Open the inspector panel, but override the default position and floating we set above.  cesdk.ui.openPanel('//ly.img.panel/inspector', {    position: 'right',    floating: true,  });
  // Return all currently open panel ids  const openPanels = cesdk.ui.findAllPanels({ open: true });});
```

  await instance.createDesignScene();});
```

```
<!doctype html><html lang="en">  <head>    <meta charset="UTF-8" />    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />    <style>      body {        margin: 0;        overflow: hidden;      }      html {        overscroll-behavior-x: contain;      }    </style>  </head>
  <body>    <div id="cesdk_container" style="width: 100%; height: 100vh"></div>    <script type="module" src="index.js"></script>  </body></html>
```

By default, the CreativeEditor SDK ships with an extensive list of commonly used formats, as shown below:

![](/docs/cesdk/_astro/page-presets.Bly6ylud_Z2mPx2y.webp)

The CE.SDK can be configured with a series of page formats that can then be selected in the editor by a user with the `Creator` [role](nextjs/concepts/editing-workflow-032d27/).

The available page formats can be controlled through the `config.ui.pagePresetLibraries` object and by creating custom asset sources or updating the content.json from the default asset source on the CDN.

To enable the CE.SDK defaults enable our default asset sources by using `addDefaultAssetSources`.

```
await addDefaultAssetSources();
```

## Configuring Custom Page Formats[#](#configuring-custom-page-formats)

You can define your own page formats by [creating a custom asset source](nextjs/import-media/from-remote-source/unsplash-8f31f0/) and by registering it in the configuration under `ui.pagePresetLibraries`. Each of the asset objects in the asset source must define a value for its `payload.transformPreset` property.

```
{  id: 'din-a1-portrait',  label: {    en: 'DIN A1 Portrait'  },  meta: {    width: 80,    height: 120,    thumbUri: `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}/din-a1-portrait.png`  },  payload: {    transformPreset: {      type: 'FixedSize',      width: 594,      height: 841,      designUnit: 'Millimeter'    }  }}
```

*   `type: type` specifies the preset type.

```
type: "FixedSize",
```

*   `width: number` specifies the width of the page in the specified design unit.

```
width: 1280,
```

*   `height: number` specifies the height of the page in the specified design unit.

```
height: 720,
```

*   `unit: 'Millimeter'|'Inch'|'Pixel'` describes unit in which `width`, `height` and `bleedMargin` are specified.

```
designUnit: 'Pixel',
```

*   `default: true` can be used to mark a page format as the default format. The asset source must be available before the scene initialization for the default to take effect.

```
default: true,
```

## Page Orientation[#](#page-orientation)

The initial orientation of a page is simply defined by the `width` and `height` properties in the format definition. For example, the `DIN A6` format defined above defaults to landscape, the `American Letter` to portrait. The orientation of a page can be changed in the editor with the button inside the document inspector. This button is disabled if the `fixedOrientation` property of the applied preset set to `true`.

## Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here’s the full code for configuring the default page formats:

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: import.meta.env.VITE_CESDK_LICENSE,  // baseURL: 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/assets',  userId: 'guides-user',  ui: {    stylesheets: {      /* ... */    },    elements: {      /* ... */    }  }};
CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk_container', config).then(async (instance) => {  // Do something with the instance of CreativeEditor SDK  // Set scale using the new API  instance.ui.setScale('normal');  // Populate the asset library with default / demo asset sources.  instance.addDefaultAssetSources();  instance.addDemoAssetSources({    sceneMode: 'Design',    withUploadAssetSources: true  });
  // Add a custom page preset asset source.  instance.engine.asset.addLocalSource('my-custom-formats');  instance.engine.asset.addAssetToSource(    'my-custom-formats',    {      id: 'din-a1-portrait',      label: {        en: 'DIN A1 Portrait'      },      meta: {        width: 80,        height: 120,        thumbUri: `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}/din-a1-portrait.png`      },      payload: {        transformPreset: {          type: 'FixedSize',          width: 594,          height: 841,          designUnit: 'Millimeter'        }      }    }  );

  await instance.createDesignScene();});
```

# Navigation Bar

Actions that affect browser navigation (e.g. going back or closing the editor), have global effects on the scene (e.g. undo/redo and zoom), or process the scene in some way (e.g. saving and exporting) should be placed in the navigation bar.

## Show or Hide the Navigation[#](#show-or-hide-the-navigation)

`show: boolean` is used to show or hide the complete navigation

`position: string` is used to set the location of the navigation bar to either top or bottom.

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',  userId: 'guides-user',  ui: {    elements: {      /* ... */      navigation: {        show: true, // 'false' to hide the navigation completely        position: 'top', // 'top' or 'bottom'        /* ... */      },      panels: {        /* ... */      },      dock: {        /* ... */      },      libraries: {        /* ... */      },      blocks: {        /* ... */      },    },  },};
CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk_container', config).then(async cesdk => {  // Set the editor view mode  cesdk.ui.setView('default');
  // Do something with the instance of CreativeEditor SDK, for example:  // Populate the asset library with default / demo asset sources.  cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();  cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({    sceneMode: 'Design',    withUploadAssetSources: true,  });  await cesdk.createDesignScene();});
```

## Configure Navigation Buttons[#](#configure-navigation-buttons)

Navigation bar components are configured dynamically using the Navigation Bar Order API. The `insertNavigationBarOrderComponent` method allows you to add or insert components into the navigation bar.

### Adding Action Buttons[#](#adding-action-buttons)

Use the actions dropdown component to add action buttons to the navigation bar:

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',  userId: 'guides-user',  ui: {    elements: {      /* ... */      navigation: {        show: true, // 'false' to hide the navigation completely        position: 'top', // 'top' or 'bottom'      },      panels: {        /* ... */      },      dock: {        /* ... */      },      libraries: {        /* ... */      },      blocks: {        /* ... */      },    },  },};
CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk_container', config).then(async cesdk => {  // Configure navigation bar actions after initialization  cesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {    id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',    children: [      'ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar',      'ly.img.importScene.navigationBar',      'ly.img.exportImage.navigationBar',      'ly.img.exportPDF.navigationBar',      'ly.img.exportScene.navigationBar',    ],  });
  // Add back button at the beginning  cesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent(    'first',    {      id: 'ly.img.back.navigationBar',      onClick: () => {        // Handle back action        window.history.back();      },    },    'before',  );
  // Add close button at the end  cesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {    id: 'ly.img.close.navigationBar',    onClick: () => {      // Handle close action      window.close();    },  });
  // Populate the asset library with default / demo asset sources.  cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();  cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({    sceneMode: 'Design',    withUploadAssetSources: true,  });  await cesdk.createDesignScene();});
```

## Custom Call-To-Action Buttons[#](#custom-call-to-action-buttons)

Custom actions are added using the Navigation Bar Order API. Add custom buttons to the actions dropdown menu with full control over their behavior:

*   `label` a string, which can be an i18n key that will be looked up in the translation table.
*   `icon` defines the icon shown on the button. You can use any of the icon ids found within our IMG.LY Icon Set ‘Essentials’ ([see full list here](nextjs/user-interface/appearance/icons-679e32/)), or any icon id that you’ve added yourself using the `addIconSet` API ([see details here](nextjs/user-interface/appearance/icons-679e32/)).
*   `onClick` a custom callback function with the signature `() => void | Promise<void>`. This function is called when the button is clicked. If the function returns a promise, the button is disabled and a spinner is shown on the button until the promise resolves.

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',  userId: 'guides-user',  ui: {    elements: {      /* ... */      navigation: {        show: true, // 'false' to hide the navigation completely        position: 'top', // 'top' or 'bottom'      },      panels: {        /* ... */      },      dock: {        /* ... */      },      libraries: {        /* ... */      },      blocks: {        /* ... */      },    },  },};
CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk_container', config).then(async cesdk => {  // Add actions dropdown with custom buttons  cesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {    id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',    children: [      // Default save button with custom behavior      {        id: 'ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar',        onClick: async () => {          const scene = await cesdk.engine.scene.saveToString();          console.log('Scene ready to save:', scene.length, 'characters');
          // Production:          // await saveToBackend(scene);
          cesdk.ui.showNotification('Scene saved successfully');        },      },      // Custom action button      {        id: 'ly.img.action.navigationBar',        key: 'custom-action', // Required for custom actions        label: 'common.custom', // string or i18n key        icon: '@imgly/Download', // icon id from our 'Essentials' set, or a custom icon id        onClick: () => {          // callback signature is `() => void | Promise<void>`          // place custom functionality here        },      },      // Share button      {        id: 'ly.img.shareScene.navigationBar',        onClick: () => {          // Custom share logic          navigator.share({            title: 'My Design',            text: 'Check out my design!',            url: window.location.href,          });        },      },    ],  });
  // Populate the asset library with default / demo asset sources.  cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();  cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({    sceneMode: 'Design',    withUploadAssetSources: true,  });  await cesdk.createDesignScene();});
```

## Rearrange Components[#](#rearrange-components)

There are 6 APIs for getting, setting, updating, removing, and inserting components in the Navigation Bar.

The content of the Navigation Bar changes based on the current [edit mode](nextjs/concepts/edit-modes-1f5b6c/) (`'Transform'` (the default), `'Text'`, `'Crop'`, `'Trim'`, or a custom value), so all APIs accept an `orderContext` argument to specify the mode.

For example usage of similar APIs, see also [Moving Existing Buttons](nextjs/user-interface/customization/rearrange-buttons-97022a/) or [Adding New Buttons](nextjs/user-interface/ui-extensions/add-new-button-74884d/) in the Guides section.

Note that the Navigation Bar is also configurable using our [UI configuration](nextjs/user-interface/customization-72b2f8/).

### Get the Current Order[#](#get-the-current-order)

```
getNavigationBarOrder(  orderContext: OrderContext = { editMode: 'Transform' })
```

When omitting the `orderContext` parameter, the order for the `'Transform'` edit mode is returned, e.g.

```
cesdk.ui.getNavigationBarOrder();// => [// {id: 'ly.img.back.navigationBar'},// {id: 'ly.img.undoRedo.navigationBar'},// ...// ]
```

### Set a new Order[#](#set-a-new-order)

```
setNavigationBarOrder(  navigationBarOrder: (NavigationBarComponentId | OrderComponent)[],  orderContext: OrderContext = { editMode: 'Transform' })
```

When omitting the `orderContext` parameter, the order is set for the default edit mode (`'Transform'`), e.g.:

```
// Sets the order for transform mode by defaultcesdk.ui.setNavigationBarOrder(['my.component.for.transform.mode']);
```

### Update Components[#](#update-components)

```
updateNavigationBarOrderComponent(  matcher: OrderComponentMatcher<OrderComponent<NavigationBarComponentId>>,  update: NavigationBarComponentId | Partial<OrderComponent<NavigationBarComponentId>> | ((component: OrderComponent<NavigationBarComponentId>) => Partial<OrderComponent<NavigationBarComponentId>>),  orderContext?: OrderContext)
```

Updates existing components in the navigation bar. The matcher can be:

*   `'first'` or `'last'` - matches the first or last component
*   A number - matches the component at that index
*   A component ID string
*   A partial object describing the component to match
*   A function that receives the component and index, returning true if it matches

The update can be:

*   A new component ID string
*   A partial object with updated properties
*   A function that receives the current component and returns the updated one

Returns an object with the number of updated components and the updated order array.

```
// Change the save button label and style for a specific contextcesdk.ui.updateNavigationBarOrderComponent(  'ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar',  component => ({    ...component,    label: 'Save Draft',    color: 'accent',  }),);
// Disable export buttons when user doesn't have export permissionscesdk.ui.updateNavigationBarOrderComponent(  { id: 'ly.img.exportImage.navigationBar' },  { isDisabled: true },);
// Replace the default actions with a custom action buttoncesdk.ui.updateNavigationBarOrderComponent(  component => component.id === 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  {    id: 'ly.img.customAction.navigationBar',    label: 'Publish',    icon: '@imgly/Share',  },);
```

### Remove Components[#](#remove-components)

```
removeNavigationBarOrderComponent(  matcher: OrderComponentMatcher<OrderComponent<NavigationBarComponentId>>,  orderContext?: OrderContext)
```

Removes components from the navigation bar. The matcher can be:

*   `'first'` or `'last'` - matches the first or last component
*   A number - matches the component at that index
*   A component ID string
*   A partial object describing the component to match
*   A function that receives the component and index, returning true if it matches

Returns an object with the number of removed components and the updated order array.

```
// Remove PDF export option for mobile userscesdk.ui.removeNavigationBarOrderComponent('ly.img.exportPDF.navigationBar');
// Remove all export buttons for users without export permissionscesdk.ui.removeNavigationBarOrderComponent(component =>  component.id.includes('export'),);
// Remove the close button in embedded modecesdk.ui.removeNavigationBarOrderComponent({  id: 'ly.img.close.navigationBar',});
```

### Insert Components[#](#insert-components)

```
insertNavigationBarOrderComponent(  matcher: OrderComponentMatcher<OrderComponent<NavigationBarComponentId>>,  component: NavigationBarComponentId | OrderComponent<NavigationBarComponentId>,  location?: InsertOrderComponentLocation,  orderContext?: OrderContext)
```

Inserts new components into the navigation bar. The matcher can be:

*   `'first'` or `'last'` - matches the first or last component
*   A number - matches the component at that index (e.g., `2`)
*   A component ID string (e.g., `'ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar'`)
*   A partial object describing the component to match (e.g., `{ id: 'ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar' }`)
*   A function that receives the component and index, returning true if it matches

The location can be:

*   `'before'` - Insert before the matched component
*   `'after'` - Insert after the matched component (default)
*   `'replace'` - Replace the matched component

Returns the updated navigation bar order array.

```
// Add actions dropdown at the end of the navigation barcesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: [    'ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar',    'ly.img.exportImage.navigationBar',  ],});
// Add a back button at the beginningcesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent(  'first',  {    id: 'ly.img.back.navigationBar',    onClick: () => window.history.back(),  },  'before',);
// Insert a custom button after the save buttoncesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent(  { id: 'ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar' },  {    id: 'ly.img.custom.navigationBar',    label: 'Custom Action',    onClick: () => console.log('Custom action'),  },  'after',);
```

## Navigation Bar Components[#](#navigation-bar-components)

The following lists the default Navigation Bar components available within CE.SDK.

### Available Action Components[#](#available-action-components)

These components can be added to the `ly.img.actions.navigationBar` container:

| Component ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar` | Save scene action - saves the current scene |
| `ly.img.importScene.navigationBar` | Load scene action - loads a scene file |
| `ly.img.exportScene.navigationBar` | Download scene action - downloads the current scene |
| `ly.img.exportImage.navigationBar` | Export as image - exports the design as an image file |
| `ly.img.exportPDF.navigationBar` | Export as PDF - exports the design as a PDF file |
| `ly.img.exportVideo.navigationBar` | Export as video - exports the design as a video file |
| `ly.img.exportArchive.navigationBar` | Create archive - creates an archive of the scene |
| `ly.img.importArchive.navigationBar` | Load archive - loads an archive file |
| `ly.img.shareScene.navigationBar` | Share action - custom share functionality |
| `ly.img.action.navigationBar` | Custom action button (requires `key` property) |

### Layout Helpers[#](#layout-helpers)

| Component ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ly.img.separator` | Adds a vertical separator (`<hr>` element) in the Navigation Bar.  
Separators follow some special layouting rules:  
\- If 2 or more separators end up next to each other (e.g. due to other components not rendering), **only 1** separator will be rendered.  
\- Separators that end up being the first or last element in the Inspector Bar will **not** be rendered.  
\- Separators directly adjacent _to the left side_ of a spacer (see below) will **not** be rendered. |
| `ly.img.spacer` | Adds horizontal spacing in the Navigation Bar.  
Spacers will try to fill all available whitespace, by distributing the available space between all spacers found in the Navigation Bar. |

### Common Controls[#](#common-controls)

| Component ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ly.img.title.navigationBar` | Title:  
A section displaying the title of the currently opened scene file.  
  
The title displayed on the UI is set by the `config.ui.elements.navigation.title` parameter. If this parameter is not specified, the system will instead check the component’s payload. To define a payload, rather than adding the ID directly to the order, insert an object structured like this: `{ id: 'ly.img.title.navigationBar', title: 'My Scene' }` |
| `ly.img.back.navigationBar` | Back button:  
A button used to navigate to the previous page. Note that this button is hidden by default, and can be configured using the UI Elements configuration. |
| `ly.img.close.navigationBar` | Close button:  
A button used to close the editor. Note that this button is hidden by default, and can be configured using the UI Elements configuration. |
| `ly.img.undoRedo.navigationBar` | Undo/Redo controls:  
Two buttons for un-doing and re-doing recent changes. |
| `ly.img.pageResize.navigationBar` | Page Resize button:  
A button used to control the page resize panel. |
| `ly.img.zoom.navigationBar` | Zoom controls:  
Two buttons for zooming the view in and out, separated by a third button showing the current zoom level and opening a dropdown offering common zoom operations (Auto-Fit Page, Fit Page, Fit Selection, 200% Zoom, 100% Zoom, 50% Zoom, Zoom In, Zoom Out). |
| `ly.img.preview.navigationBar` | Preview button:  
Toggles Preview mode, which allows viewing and editing the scene like an Adopter would (e.g. with all Placeholder constraints enforced). Changes made in Preview are not saved and will be discarded when leaving Preview. |
| `ly.img.actions.navigationBar` | Call To Action buttons:  
A dropdown container for action buttons. You can customize its children to include any combination of save, export, load, and custom action buttons. The first child appears as a prominent button in the navigation bar, while additional children appear in the dropdown menu. |

## Default Order[#](#default-order)

The default order of the Navigation Bar is the following:

```
[  'ly.img.undoRedo.navigationBar',  'ly.img.pageResize.navigationBar',  'ly.img.spacer',  'ly.img.title.navigationBar',  'ly.img.spacer',  'ly.img.zoom.navigationBar',  'ly.img.preview.navigationBar',];
```

## Integration with Callbacks API[#](#integration-with-callbacks-api)

Action buttons in the navigation bar automatically trigger the corresponding callbacks registered with the Callbacks API when used as string IDs. You can also provide custom onClick handlers to override the default behavior.

### Using Registered Callbacks[#](#using-registered-callbacks)

```
// Register callbacks with the Callbacks APIcesdk.actions.register('saveScene', async () => {  const scene = await cesdk.engine.scene.saveToString();  console.log('Scene ready to save:', scene.length, 'characters');
  // Production:  // await fetch('/api/scenes', {  //   method: 'POST',  //   body: JSON.stringify({ scene }),  //   headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },  // });
  cesdk.ui.showNotification('Scene saved successfully');});
cesdk.actions.register('exportDesign', async options => {  const { blobs, options: exportOptions } = await cesdk.utils.export(options);  console.log('Export ready:', blobs[0].size, 'bytes');
  // Production:  // await uploadToCDN(blobs[0]);
  cesdk.ui.showNotification('Export successful');});
// Add navigation buttons that will use registered callbackscesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: [    'ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar', // Uses registered saveScene callback    'ly.img.exportImage.navigationBar', // Uses registered exportDesign callback  ],});
```

### Custom onClick Override[#](#custom-onclick-override)

```
// Override default callback with custom onClick handlercesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: [    {      id: 'ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar',      onClick: async () => {        // Custom logic that overrides the registered callback        const scene = await cesdk.engine.scene.saveToString();        console.log('Scene ready for custom save:', scene.length, 'characters');
        // Production:        // await customSaveLogic(scene);      },    },  ],});
```

## Default Behaviors[#](#default-behaviors)

The following action components trigger their corresponding callbacks when used as string IDs:

| Component ID | Callback Triggered | Default Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar` | `saveScene` | Downloads the scene as a `.scene` file to the user’s device |
| `ly.img.importScene.navigationBar` | `importScene` | Opens a file picker to load a `.scene` file from the user’s device |
| `ly.img.exportScene.navigationBar` | `exportScene` | Downloads the current scene as a `.scene` file |
| `ly.img.exportImage.navigationBar` | `exportDesign` | Exports and downloads the design as an image file (PNG/JPEG) |
| `ly.img.exportPDF.navigationBar` | `exportDesign` | Exports and downloads the design as a PDF file |
| `ly.img.exportVideo.navigationBar` | `exportDesign` | Exports and downloads the design as a video file (MP4) |
| `ly.img.exportArchive.navigationBar` | `exportScene` | Creates and downloads an archive of the scene with all assets |
| `ly.img.importArchive.navigationBar` | `importScene` | Opens a file picker to load an archive file |
| `ly.img.shareScene.navigationBar` | `shareScene` | No default behavior - requires callback registration |

## Using Default vs Custom Behaviors[#](#using-default-vs-custom-behaviors)

### Example 1: Default Behavior[#](#example-1-default-behavior)

When using just the string ID without registering a custom callback, the default behavior is triggered (downloads the file to the user’s device):

```
// Using default behavior - downloads scene file to user's devicecesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: [    'ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar', // Uses default download behavior  ],});
```

### Example 2: Custom Behavior via Registered Callback[#](#example-2-custom-behavior-via-registered-callback)

Register a custom callback to override the default behavior for all instances of the button:

```
// Register custom saveScene callbackcesdk.actions.register('saveScene', async () => {  const scene = await cesdk.engine.scene.saveToString();  console.log('Scene ready to save:', scene.length, 'characters');
  // Production:  // await fetch('/api/scenes', {  //   method: 'POST',  //   body: JSON.stringify({ scene }),  //   headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },  // });
  cesdk.ui.showNotification('Scene saved to cloud');});
// String ID now uses the registered callback instead of defaultcesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: [    'ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar', // Triggers registered saveScene callback  ],});
```

### Example 3: Custom Behavior via onClick Handler[#](#example-3-custom-behavior-via-onclick-handler)

Provide a custom onClick handler directly in the component configuration to override both default and registered callbacks:

```
// Override with custom onClick handlercesdk.ui.insertNavigationBarOrderComponent('last', {  id: 'ly.img.actions.navigationBar',  children: [    {      id: 'ly.img.saveScene.navigationBar',      onClick: async () => {        // This custom onClick overrides any registered callback        const scene = await cesdk.engine.scene.saveToString();        console.log(          'Scene ready for alternative save:',          scene.length,          'characters',        );
        // Production:        // await alternativeSaveLogic(scene);
        cesdk.ui.showNotification('Saved with alternative method');      },    },  ],});
```

# Inspector Bar

The main location for block-specific functionality is the inspector bar. Any action or setting available to the user for the currently selected block that does not appear in the canvas menu should be added here.

## Show or Hide the Inspector Bar[#](#show-or-hide-the-inspector-bar)

Two different views of the editor are available:

*   The ‘advanced’ view always shows an inspector panel to the side of the canvas.
*   The ‘default’ view hides the inspector panel until it is needed, and uses a minimal inspector bar on top of the canvas instead.

Use `cesdk.ui.setView()` to toggle between `'advanced'` and `'default'` view after initializing the editor.

```

```

## Show or Hide Sections[#](#show-or-hide-sections)

*   `opacity: boolean` shows or hides the `opacity` section in the inspector ui for every block.
*   `transform: boolean` shows or hides the `transform` section in the inspector ui for every block.
*   `adjustments: boolean` shows or hides the `adjustments` section in the inspector ui for the image block.
*   `filters: boolean` shows or hides the `filters` section in the inspector ui for the image block.
*   `effects: boolean` shows or hides the `effects` section in the inspector ui for the image block.
*   `blur: boolean` shows or hides the `blur` section in the inspector ui for the image block.
*   `crop: boolean` shows or hides the `crop` section in the inspector ui for the image block.

## Rearrange Components[#](#rearrange-components)

There are 6 APIs for getting, setting, updating, removing, and inserting components in the Inspector Bar.

The content of the Inspector Bar changes based on the current [edit mode](nextjs/concepts/edit-modes-1f5b6c/) (`'Transform'` (the default), `'Text'`, `'Crop'`, `'Trim'`, or a custom value), so all APIs accept an `orderContext` argument to specify the mode.

For example usage of these APIs, see also [Moving Existing Buttons](nextjs/user-interface/customization/rearrange-buttons-97022a/) in the Guides section.

### Get the Current Order[#](#get-the-current-order)

```
cesdk.ui.getInspectorBarOrder(  ((orderContext: OrderContext) = { editMode: 'Transform' }));
```

When omitting the `orderContext` parameter, the order for the `'Transform'` edit mode is returned, e.g.

```
cesdk.ui.getInspectorBarOrder();// => [// {id: 'ly.img.text.typeFace.inspectorBar'},// {id: 'ly.img.text.fontSize.inspectorBar'},// ...// ]
```

### Set a new Order[#](#set-a-new-order)

```
cesdk.ui.setInspectorBarOrder(  inspectorBarOrder: (InspectorBarComponentId | OrderComponent)[],  orderContext: OrderContext = { editMode: 'Transform' })
```

When omitting the `orderContext` parameter, the order is set for the default edit mode (`'Transform'`), e.g.:

```
// Sets the order for transform mode by defaultcesdk.ui.setInspectorBarOrder(['my.component.for.transform.mode']);
```

### Update Components[#](#update-components)

```
updateInspectorBarOrderComponent(  matcher: OrderComponentMatcher<OrderComponent<InspectorBarComponentId>>,  update: InspectorBarComponentId | Partial<OrderComponent<InspectorBarComponentId>> | ((component: OrderComponent<InspectorBarComponentId>) => Partial<OrderComponent<InspectorBarComponentId>>),  orderContext?: OrderContext)
```

Updates existing components in the inspector bar. The matcher can be:

*   `'first'` or `'last'` - matches the first or last component
*   A number - matches the component at that index
*   A component ID string
*   A partial object describing the component to match
*   A function that receives the component and index, returning true if it matches

The update can be:

*   A new component ID string
*   A partial object with updated properties
*   A function that receives the current component and returns the updated one

Returns an object with the number of updated components and the updated order array.

```
// Replace the fill controls with a custom fill componentcesdk.ui.updateInspectorBarOrderComponent(  'ly.img.fill.inspectorBar',  'custom-fill',);
// Replace text controls with simplified versions for basic userscesdk.ui.updateInspectorBarOrderComponent(  component => component.id === 'ly.img.text.fontSize.inspectorBar',  'my-custom-font-size-component',);
```

### Remove Components[#](#remove-components)

```
removeInspectorBarOrderComponent(  matcher: OrderComponentMatcher<OrderComponent<InspectorBarComponentId>>,  orderContext?: OrderContext)
```

Removes components from the inspector bar. The matcher can be:

*   `'first'` or `'last'` - matches the first or last component
*   A number - matches the component at that index
*   A component ID string
*   A partial object describing the component to match
*   A function that receives the component and index, returning true if it matches

Returns an object with the number of removed components and the updated order array.

```
// Remove advanced text controls for simplified interfacecesdk.ui.removeInspectorBarOrderComponent('ly.img.text.advanced.inspectorBar');
// Remove all filter and effect controls for basic userscesdk.ui.removeInspectorBarOrderComponent(  component =>    component.id.includes('filter') || component.id.includes('effect'),);
// Remove shadow controls for specific block typescesdk.ui.removeInspectorBarOrderComponent({ id: 'ly.img.shadow.inspectorBar' });
```

### Insert Components[#](#insert-components)

```
insertInspectorBarOrderComponent(  matcher: OrderComponentMatcher<OrderComponent<InspectorBarComponentId>>,  component: InspectorBarComponentId | OrderComponent<InspectorBarComponentId>,  location?: InsertOrderComponentLocation,  orderContext?: OrderContext)
```

Inserts new components into the inspector bar. The matcher can be:

*   `'first'` or `'last'` - matches the first or last component
*   A number - matches the component at that index
*   A component ID string
*   A partial object describing the component to match
*   A function that receives the component and index, returning true if it matches

The location can be:

*   `'before'` - Insert before the matched component
*   `'after'` - Insert after the matched component (default)
*   `'replace'` - Replace the matched component
*   `'asChild'` - Insert as a child of the matched component

Returns the updated inspector bar order array.

```
// Add a custom control after the fill controlscesdk.ui.insertInspectorBarOrderComponent(  'ly.img.fill.inspectorBar',  'my-custom-component',);
// Add a separator before the stroke controls for better organizationcesdk.ui.insertInspectorBarOrderComponent(  'ly.img.stroke.inspectorBar',  'ly.img.separator',  'before',);
// Replace the default options with a custom options componentcesdk.ui.insertInspectorBarOrderComponent(  'ly.img.options.inspectorBar',  'ly.img.customOptions.inspectorBar',  'replace',);
```

## Inspector Bar Components[#](#inspector-bar-components)

The following lists the default Inspector Bar components available within CE.SDK.

Take special note of the “Feature ID” column. Most components can be hidden/disabled by disabling the corresponding feature using the Feature API.

Also note that many components are only rendered for the block types listed in the “Renders for” column, because their associated controls (e.g. font size) are only meaningful for specific kinds of blocks (e.g. text).

### Layout Helpers[#](#layout-helpers)

| Component ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ly.img.separator` | Adds a vertical separator (`<hr>` element) in the Inspector Bar.  
Separators follow some special layouting rules:  
\- If 2 or more separators end up next to each other (e.g. due to other components not rendering), **only 1** separator will be rendered.  
\- Separators that end up being the first or last element in the Inspector Bar will **not** be rendered.  
\- Separators directly adjacent _to the left side_ of a spacer (see below) will **not** be rendered. |
| `ly.img.spacer` | Adds horizontal spacing in the Inspector Bar.  
Spacers will try to fill all available whitespace, by distributing the available space between all spacers found in the Inspector Bar. |

# Force Crop

The `applyForceCrop` API allows you to programmatically apply a crop preset to a specific design block. This is useful in scenarios where you want to enforce a particular format (e.g., fixed aspect ratio) and define how the editor should respond after the preset is applied.

* * *

## Overview[#](#overview)

You can use `applyForceCrop` to apply a predefined crop preset to a selected block (typically an image or other block that supports cropping). The API provides flexible behavior through the `mode` parameter, controlling whether the crop UI is shown and whether cropping is conditionally applied based on the block’s current dimensions.

This API is available on the UI namespace as `cesdk.ui.applyForceCrop`.

```
cesdk.ui.applyForceCrop(blockId: DesignBlock, {  sourceId: string;  presetId: string;  mode: 'silent' | 'always' | 'ifNeeded';}): Promise<void>;
```

* * *

## Parameters[#](#parameters)

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blockId` | `DesignBlock` | The ID of the block you want to apply the crop to. Must support cropping. |
| `sourceId` | `string` | ID of the asset source where the crop preset is defined. |
| `presetId` | `string` | ID of the crop preset to apply. |
| `mode` | `"silent" | "always" | "ifNeeded"` | Defines how the UI should behave after applying the crop. See below. |

* * *

## Modes[#](#modes)

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `silent` | Applies the preset without opening the crop UI. |
| `always` | Applies the preset and always switches to crop mode in the UI. |
| `ifNeeded` | Only applies the preset if the block’s current dimensions or aspect ratio differ from the preset. Switches to crop mode only if a change is made. |

* * *

## Usage Example[#](#usage-example)

```
const ui = cesdk.ui;const engine = cesdk.engine;
const blockId = engine.block.findAllSelected()[0];
// Add a new custom presetengine.asset.addAssetToSource('ly.img.crop.presets', {  id: 'custom-preset',  label: {    en: 'Custom Preset',    de: 'Custom Preset',  },  payload: {    transformPreset: {      type: 'FixedSize',      width: 900,      height: 900,      designUnit: 'Pixel',    },  },});
// Apply the preset to the selected blockawait ui.applyForceCrop(blockId, {  mode: 'ifNeeded',  presetId: 'custom-preset',  sourceId: 'ly.img.crop.presets',});
```

You can also apply presets shipped with CE.SDK, such as:

```
await ui.applyForceCrop(blockId, {  mode: 'ifNeeded',  presetId: 'aspect-ratio-1-1',  sourceId: 'ly.img.crop.presets',});
```

* * *

## Behavior Details[#](#behavior-details)

*   `applyForceCrop` bypasses the usual user interaction required to apply crop presets manually.
*   When used in `always` or `ifNeeded` mode, the crop UI is automatically opened (if appropriate).
*   This function hides the dimension inputs from the crop panel for a cleaner editing experience.
*   Invalid `presetId`, `sourceId`, or `mode` values will result in console warning output.

* * *

[Source](https:/img.ly/docs/cesdk/nextjs/user-interface/customization/dock-cb916c)

# Dock

The dock is the main entry point for user interactions not directly related to the currently selected block. It occupies a prominent place in the editor and is primarily, though not exclusively, used to open panels with asset libraries. Therefore, the default and recommended position of the asset library panel is on the side of the dock. However, depending on the use case, it might be beneficial to add other buttons and functionalities (even block-specific ones) to highlight them due to the prominence of the dock.

## Configure Dock[#](#configure-dock)

You can configure dock appearance using the editor settings API:

*   `dock/iconSize` - Sets the dock button icon size to `'large'` (24px) or `'normal'` (16px)
*   `dock/hideLabels` - Shows or hides the labels inside dock buttons (`true` to hide, `false` to show)

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',  userId: 'guides-user',};
CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk_container', config).then(async cesdk => {  // Configure dock appearance  cesdk.engine.editor.setSetting('dock/iconSize', 'large');  cesdk.engine.editor.setSetting('dock/hideLabels', false);
  // Set the editor view mode  cesdk.ui.setView('default');
  // Do something with the instance of CreativeEditor SDK, for example:  // Populate the asset library with default / demo asset sources.  cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();  cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({    sceneMode: 'Design',    withUploadAssetSources: true,  });  await cesdk.createDesignScene();});
```

## Rearrange Dock Components[#](#rearrange-dock-components)

There are 6 APIs for getting, setting, updating, removing, and inserting components in the Dock.

The content of the Dock changes based on the current [edit mode](nextjs/concepts/edit-modes-1f5b6c/) (`'Transform'` (the default), `'Text'`, `'Crop'`, `'Trim'`, or a custom value), so all APIs accept an `orderContext` argument to specify the mode.

For example usage of these APIs, see also [Moving Existing Buttons](nextjs/user-interface/customization/rearrange-buttons-97022a/) or [Adding New Buttons](nextjs/user-interface/ui-extensions/add-new-button-74884d/) in the Guides section.

### Get the Current Order[#](#get-the-current-order)

```
getDockOrder(  orderContext: OrderContext = { editMode: 'Transform' })
```

When omitting the `orderContext` parameter, the order for the `'Transform'` edit mode is returned, e.g.

```
cesdk.ui.getDockOrder();// [//   {//     id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock',//     key: 'ly.img.template',//     icon: '@imgly/Template',//     label: 'libraries.ly.img.template.label',//     entries: [ 'ly.img.template' ]//   },//   ...// ]
```

### Set a new Order[#](#set-a-new-order)

```
setDockOrder(  dockOrder: (DockOrderComponentId | DockOrderComponent)[],  orderContext: OrderContext = { editMode: 'Transform' })
```

When omitting the `orderContext` parameter, the order is set for the default edit mode (`'Transform'`), e.g.:

```
// Sets the order for transform mode by defaultcesdk.ui.setDockOrder(['my.component.for.transform.mode']);
```

### Update Components[#](#update-components)

```
updateDockOrderComponent(  matcher: OrderComponentMatcher<OrderComponent<DockOrderComponentId>>,  update: DockOrderComponentId | Partial<OrderComponent<DockOrderComponentId>> | ((component: OrderComponent<DockOrderComponentId>) => Partial<OrderComponent<DockOrderComponentId>>),  orderContext?: OrderContext)
```

Updates existing components in the dock. The matcher can be:

*   `'first'` or `'last'` - matches the first or last component
*   A number - matches the component at that index
*   A component ID string
*   A partial object describing the component to match
*   A function that receives the component and index, returning true if it matches

The update can be:

*   A new component ID string
*   A partial object with updated properties
*   A function that receives the current component and returns the updated one

Returns an object with the number of updated components and the updated order array.

```
// Change the icon and label for the image librarycesdk.ui.updateDockOrderComponent(  { id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock', key: 'ly.img.image' },  component => ({    ...component,    icon: '@imgly/Photo',    label: 'My Photos',    entries: ['ly.img.image', 'ly.img.custom.photos'],  }),);
// Update the upload library label for different user contextscesdk.ui.updateDockOrderComponent(  { id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock', key: 'ly.img.upload' },  { label: 'Upload Files' },);
// Update the entries for the elements library to show only specific categoriescesdk.ui.updateDockOrderComponent(  { id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock', key: 'ly.img.elements' },  { entries: ['ly.img.image', 'ly.img.text', 'ly.img.vectorpath'] },);
```

### Remove Components[#](#remove-components)

```
removeDockOrderComponent(  matcher: OrderComponentMatcher<OrderComponent<DockOrderComponentId>>,  orderContext?: OrderContext)
```

Removes components from the dock. The matcher can be:

*   `'first'` or `'last'` - matches the first or last component
*   A number - matches the component at that index
*   A component ID string
*   A partial object describing the component to match
*   A function that receives the component and index, returning true if it matches

Returns an object with the number of removed components and the updated order array.

```
// Remove the video library for mobile userscesdk.ui.removeDockOrderComponent(  component =>    component.id === 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock' &&    component.key === 'ly.img.video',);
// Remove all template libraries for users without template accesscesdk.ui.removeDockOrderComponent(  component =>    component.id === 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock' &&    component.key &&    component.key.includes('template'),);
// Remove the audio library by keycesdk.ui.removeDockOrderComponent({  id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock',  key: 'ly.img.audio',});
```

### Insert Components[#](#insert-components)

```
insertDockOrderComponent(  matcher: OrderComponentMatcher<OrderComponent<DockOrderComponentId>>,  component: DockOrderComponentId | OrderComponent<DockOrderComponentId>,  location?: InsertOrderComponentLocation,  orderContext?: OrderContext)
```

Inserts new components into the dock. The matcher can be:

*   `'first'` or `'last'` - matches the first or last component
*   A number - matches the component at that index
*   A component ID string
*   A partial object describing the component to match
*   A function that receives the component and index, returning true if it matches

The location can be:

*   `'before'` - Insert before the matched component
*   `'after'` - Insert after the matched component (default)
*   `'replace'` - Replace the matched component
*   `'asChild'` - Insert as a child of the matched component

> **Note:** The `'asChild'` option is only supported for custom components that you register via `registerComponent`. Built-in dock components like `ly.img.assetLibrary.dock` do not support yet take advantage of this pattern.

Returns the updated dock order array.

```
// Add a custom asset library after the image librarycesdk.ui.insertDockOrderComponent(  { id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock', key: 'ly.img.image' },  {    id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock',    key: 'ly.img.custom',    icon: 'custom-icon',    label: 'Custom Assets',    entries: ['ly.img.custom', 'ly.img.brand'],  },);
// Add a separator before the upload library for better organizationcesdk.ui.insertDockOrderComponent(  { id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock', key: 'ly.img.upload' },  'ly.img.separator',  'before',);
// Replace the elements library with a simplified versioncesdk.ui.insertDockOrderComponent(  { id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock', key: 'ly.img.elements' },  {    id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock',    key: 'ly.img.elements.simple',    icon: '@imgly/Library',    label: 'Basic Elements',    entries: ['ly.img.image', 'ly.img.text'],  },  'replace',);
```

## Dock Components[#](#dock-components)

The following lists the default Dock components available within CE.SDK.

### Layout Helpers[#](#layout-helpers)

| Component ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ly.img.separator` | Adds a small space (invisible `<hr>` element) in the Dock to help the visual separation of entries.  
Separators follow some special layouting rules:  
\- If 2 or more separators end up next to each other (e.g. due to other components not rendering), **only 1** separator will be rendered.  
\- Separators that end up being the first or last element in the Dock will **not** be rendered.  
\- Separators directly adjacent _to the top side_ of a spacer (see below) will **not** be rendered. |
| `ly.img.spacer` | Adds vertical spacing in the Dock.  
Spacers will try to fill all available whitespace, by distributing the available space between all spacers found in the Dock. |

### Asset Library[#](#asset-library)

| Component ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ly.img.assetLibrary.dock` | Asset Library:  
A button that opens the Asset Library Panel, showing the content of one or more associated asset entries. Requires additional keys to be set on the object passed to `setDockOrder`, as described below. |

#### Payload[#](#payload)

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | `string` | Needs to be unique within the set of components in the Dock. |
| `label` | `string` | Used as a label for the button. If a matching I18N key is found, the label is localized. |
| `icon` | `CustomIcon` | One of 3 things:  
\-A URL string pointing to an SVG image, or:  
\- The string identifier of a custom or built-in icon (see [Icons](nextjs/user-interface/appearance/icons-679e32/)), or:  
\- A callback returning a URL, which takes a single parameter of type `{theme: string, iconSize: 'normal' | 'large' }`. |
| `entries` | `string[]` | List of Asset Entries that will be shown in the Asset Library Panel when pressing the button. A single entry will open that entry directly. Multiple entries will show a group overview. |

#### Example Usage[#](#example-usage)

```
// Set the Dock Order to show only the Image Asset Library.cesdk.ui.setDockOrder([  {    id: 'ly.img.assetLibrary.dock', // Component id    // All other keys are payload / parameters passed to the component    key: 'ly.img.image',    icon: '@imgly/Image',    label: 'libraries.ly.img.image.label', // Using a I18N key    entries: [      'ly.img.image', // Only 1 entry is to be shown    ],  },]);
```

## Default Order[#](#default-order)

```

# Disable or Enable Features

## Enable Feature[#](#enable-feature)

The following API allows to enable a custom or built-in feature (see the list of built-in features below):

```
enable(featureId: FeatureId | FeatureId[])
```

This method enables one or more features using their default predicates. If you need custom predicate logic, use the `set()` method instead (see below).

Tip: `FeatureId` can be an arbitrary string, so you can use this mechanism to toggle your own custom features, as well.

### Example: Enable Single Feature[#](#example-enable-single-feature)

```
// Enable a feature with its default predicatecesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.delete');
```

### Example: Enable Multiple Features[#](#example-enable-multiple-features)

```
// Enable multiple features at oncecesdk.feature.enable(['ly.img.delete', 'ly.img.duplicate']);
```

### Example: Enable with Glob Pattern[#](#example-enable-with-glob-pattern)

```
// Enable all video featurescesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.video.*');
// Enable all crop featurescesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.crop.*');
```

## Disable Feature[#](#disable-feature)

The `disable()` method provides a convenient way to explicitly disable one or more features:

```
disable(featureId: FeatureId | FeatureId[])
```

This method disables features by setting their enable/disable state to `false`. Note that `disable()` works best with `enable()` for simple on/off control. If you’ve used `set()` with boolean predicates, those will be evaluated first and may override the disable state.

### Example: Disable Single Feature[#](#example-disable-single-feature)

```
cesdk.feature.disable('ly.img.delete');
```

### Example: Disable Multiple Features[#](#example-disable-multiple-features)

```
cesdk.feature.disable(['ly.img.delete', 'ly.img.duplicate']);
```

### Example: Disable with Glob Pattern[#](#example-disable-with-glob-pattern)

```
// Disable all video featurescesdk.feature.disable('ly.img.video.*');
// Disable all crop featurescesdk.feature.disable('ly.img.crop.*');
```

## Set Feature[#](#set-feature)

The `set()` method is the unified approach for configuring feature state with custom predicates:

```
set(featureId: FeatureId, enabled: boolean | FeaturePredicate)
```

The `enabled` parameter can be:

*   A boolean (`true` or `false`) to enable or disable the feature
*   A function (predicate) that takes a context and returns a boolean

The predicate function receives an `EnableFeatureContext` with:

*   `engine: CreativeEngine` - The engine instance
*   `isPreviousEnable: () => boolean` - Returns the result of any previously registered predicates
*   `defaultPredicate: () => boolean` - Returns the result of the default predicate

### Understanding Predicate Chaining and Evaluation Order[#](#understanding-predicate-chaining-and-evaluation-order)

Multiple predicates can be registered for the same feature, forming a **predicate chain**. Understanding the evaluation order is crucial:

**Evaluation Order:**

1.  **Most recent `set()` predicate** runs FIRST
2.  **Older `set()` predicates** in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
3.  **`enable()`/`disable()` state** runs LAST

This means:

*   **`set()` predicates can override `enable()` and `disable()`** - They’re evaluated first
*   **Boolean predicates are always terminal** - They immediately return their value without continuing the chain
*   **Function predicates control the chain** - The function implementation decides whether to call `isPreviousEnable()` (continue chain) or return directly (end chain)

**Key Principles:**

*   Use `enable()` and `disable()` for simple on/off control
*   Use `set()` when you need custom logic or want to override enable/disable
*   Each `set()` call adds a new predicate to the front of the chain
*   Boolean predicates (true/false) are always terminal - they cannot continue the chain
*   Function predicates decide whether to continue the chain by calling `isPreviousEnable()`, or end it by returning directly

### Example: Enable Feature[#](#example-enable-feature)

```
cesdk.feature.set('ly.img.delete', true);
```

### Example: Disable Feature[#](#example-disable-feature)

```
cesdk.feature.set('ly.img.delete', false);
```

**Important:** Using `set()` with a boolean creates a terminal predicate. If you later call `enable()` or `disable()`, they won’t have an effect because `set()` predicates are evaluated first:

```
// This creates a terminal predicatecesdk.feature.set('ly.img.delete', true);
// This won't disable the feature because set(true) is terminalcesdk.feature.disable('ly.img.delete');// Feature is still enabled!
// For simple on/off, use enable() and disable() instead:cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.delete'); // Enabledcesdk.feature.disable('ly.img.delete'); // Now disabled
```

### Example: Custom Predicate[#](#example-custom-predicate)

```
cesdk.feature.set('ly.img.delete', ({ engine }) => {  const selectedBlocks = engine.block.findAllSelected();  return selectedBlocks.length > 0;});
```

### Example: Extending Default Predicate[#](#example-extending-default-predicate)

You can extend the default predicate provided for built-in features:

```
cesdk.feature.set('ly.img.delete', ({ defaultPredicate }) => {  // Only allow delete after 10 pm  return defaultPredicate() && new Date().getHours() >= 22;});
```

### Example: Chaining Predicates[#](#example-chaining-predicates)

Predicates can access the result of previously registered predicates:

```
// First, enable with defaultcesdk.feature.enable('my.feature');
// Then, add additional logic that chains with previous predicatescesdk.feature.set('my.feature', ({ isPreviousEnable }) => {  // Disable the feature after 10 pm, otherwise use previous result  return new Date().getHours() >= 22 ? false : isPreviousEnable();});
```

### Example: Overwriting Defaults for Custom Block Types[#](#example-overwriting-defaults-for-custom-block-types)

Let’s say you introduced a new kind of block that represents an Avatar. You want to hide the duplicate & delete buttons in the canvas menu for this block:

```
cesdk.feature.set('ly.img.delete', ({ engine, isPreviousEnable }) => {  const selectedBlock = engine.block.findAllSelected()[0];  const kind = engine.block.getKind(selectedBlock);  if (kind === 'avatar') {    return false;  } else {    return isPreviousEnable();  }});
cesdk.feature.set('ly.img.duplicate', ({ engine, isPreviousEnable }) => {  const selectedBlock = engine.block.findAllSelected()[0];  const kind = engine.block.getKind(selectedBlock);  if (kind === 'avatar') {    return false;  } else {    return isPreviousEnable();  }});
```

### Example: Glob Pattern with Predicate[#](#example-glob-pattern-with-predicate)

```
// Apply custom logic to all video featurescesdk.feature.set('ly.img.video.*', ({ engine }) => {  return engine.scene.getMode() === 'Video';});
```

## Check Feature[#](#check-feature)

The following API allows to query if the feature is currently enabled:

```
isEnabled(featureId: FeatureId): boolean
```

This method returns `true` if the feature is currently enabled, `false` otherwise.

### Example[#](#example)

```
if (!cesdk.feature.isEnabled('ly.img.navigation.close')) {  return null;}
// Check multiple featuresif (  cesdk.feature.isEnabled('ly.img.delete') &&  cesdk.feature.isEnabled('ly.img.duplicate')) {  console.log('Both delete and duplicate are enabled');}
// Check with glob patternif (cesdk.feature.isEnabled('ly.img.video.*')) {  console.log('All video features are enabled');}
```

## List Features[#](#list-features)

The `list()` method returns all registered feature IDs, with optional pattern matching:

```
list(options?: { matcher?: string }): FeatureId[]
```

This method is useful for discovering available features and debugging feature configurations.

### Example: List All Features[#](#example-list-all-features)

```
const allFeatures = cesdk.feature.list();console.log('All features:', allFeatures);
```

### Example: List with Pattern Matching[#](#example-list-with-pattern-matching)

```
// List all video featuresconst videoFeatures = cesdk.feature.list({ matcher: 'ly.img.video.*' });
// List all crop featuresconst cropFeatures = cesdk.feature.list({ matcher: 'ly.img.crop.*' });
// List all navigation featuresconst navFeatures = cesdk.feature.list({ matcher: 'ly.img.navigation.*' });
```

## Get Feature Predicates[#](#get-feature-predicates)

The `get()` method allows you to retrieve the predicates associated with a feature:

```
get(featureId: FeatureId): FeaturePredicate[] | undefined
```

This is useful for debugging or understanding what predicates have been registered for a feature.

### Example[#](#example-1)

```
const predicates = cesdk.feature.get('ly.img.delete');console.log(`Feature has ${predicates?.length || 0} predicates`);
```

## Glob Pattern Support[#](#glob-pattern-support)

All main Feature API methods support glob pattern matching for batch operations, allowing you to control multiple related features at once.

### Supported Methods[#](#supported-methods)

*   `enable(pattern)` - Enable all matching features
*   `disable(pattern)` - Disable all matching features
*   `set(pattern, predicate)` - Set all matching features
*   `isEnabled(pattern)` - Check if all matching features are enabled
*   `list({ matcher: pattern })` - List features matching pattern

### Pattern Syntax[#](#pattern-syntax)

*   `*` matches any sequence of characters within a segment
*   `ly.img.video.*` matches all features starting with `ly.img.video.`
*   `ly.img.crop.*` matches all features starting with `ly.img.crop.`

### Examples[#](#examples)

```
// Enable all video featurescesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.video.*');
// Disable all crop featurescesdk.feature.disable('ly.img.crop.*');
// Check if all navigation features are enabledconst allEnabled = cesdk.feature.isEnabled('ly.img.navigation.*');
// Set all filter features with custom predicatecesdk.feature.set('ly.img.filter.*', ({ engine }) => {  const selectedBlocks = engine.block.findAllSelected();  return selectedBlocks.some((id) => engine.block.hasEffects(id));});
// List all features in a namespaceconst allVideoFeatures = cesdk.feature.list({ matcher: 'ly.img.video.*' });
```

### Best Practices[#](#best-practices)

*   Use glob patterns to manage related features together
*   Combine with predicates for conditional bulk operations
*   Use `list()` with matchers to discover available features in a namespace

```

By default, the CreativeEditor SDK ships with an extensive list of commonly used crop presets, as shown below:

![](/docs/cesdk/_astro/crop-presets.65SiE7vt_ZAWUF2.webp)

The CE.SDK can be configured with a series of crop presets by creating custom asset sources or updating the content.json from the default asset source on the CDN, and then using the API to update the crop presets library entry.

To enable the CE.SDK defaults enable our default asset sources by using `addDefaultAssetSources`.

```
await addDefaultAssetSources();
```

## Configuring Custom Crop Presets[#](#configuring-custom-crop-presets)

You can define your own crop presets by [creating a custom asset source](nextjs/import-media/from-remote-source/unsplash-8f31f0/) and then updating the crop presets library entry using `cesdk.ui.updateAssetLibraryEntry('ly.img.cropPresets', { sourceIds: [...] })`. Each of the asset objects in the asset source must define a value for its `payload.transformPreset` property.

### Fixed Aspect Ratio[#](#fixed-aspect-ratio)

When a fixed aspect ratio preset is applied it will resize the crop frame based on the `width` and `height` values provided.

```
{  id: 'aspect-ratio-16-9',  label: {    en: '16:9'  },  meta: {    width: 80,    height: 120,    thumbUri: `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}/ratio-16-9.png`  },  payload: {    transformPreset: {      type: 'FixedAspectRatio',      width: 16,      height: 9    }  }}
```

*   `type: type` specifies the preset type.

```
type: "FixedAspectRatio",
```

*   `width: number` specifies the width of the crop frame.

```
width: 16,
```

*   `height: number` specifies the height of the crop frame.

```
height: 9,
```

### Free Aspect Ratio[#](#free-aspect-ratio)

When a free aspect ratio preset is applied it will enable the side-handles of the crop frame.

```
{  id: 'aspect-ratio-free',  label: {    en: 'Free'  },  meta: {    width: 80,    height: 120,    thumbUri: `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}/ratio-free.png`  },  payload: {    transformPreset: {      type: 'FreeAspectRatio'    }  }}
```

*   `type: type` specifies the preset type.

```
type: "FreeAspectRatio",
```

### Fixed Size[#](#fixed-size)

When a fixed size preset is applied it will resize the selected block to the `width` and `height` provided.

```
{  id: 'din-a1-portrait',  label: {    en: 'DIN A1 Portrait'  },  meta: {    width: 80,    height: 120,    thumbUri: `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}/din-a1-portrait.png`  },  payload: {    transformPreset: {      type: 'FixedSize',      width: 594,      height: 841,      designUnit: 'Millimeter'    }  }}
```

*   `type: type` specifies the preset type.

```
type: "FixedSize",
```

*   `width: number` specifies the width of the page in the specified design unit.

```
width: 1280,
```

*   `height: number` specifies the height of the page in the specified design unit.

```
height: 720,
```

*   `unit: 'Millimeter'|'Inch'|'Pixel'` describes unit in which `width`, `height` and `bleedMargin` are specified.

```
designUnit: 'Pixel',
```

## Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here’s the full code for configuring the default page formats:

# Color Palette

By default, the CreativeEditor SDK ships with a predefined set of default colors:

![](/docs/cesdk/_astro/colorpalette-light.CsJFOIbe_1debYO.webp)

The CE.SDK can be configured with a series of colors that can be directly used whenever a color needs to be chosen. These color libraries need to be provided as asset sources - see our guide on [Custom Color Libraries](nextjs/colors/create-color-palette-7012e0/) for more details on how this is achieved.

## Configure library list[#](#configure-library-list)

*   The list of libraries can be configured using `cesdk.ui.updateAssetLibraryEntry('ly.img.colors', { sourceIds: [...] })`. Each asset source listed here will appear in the color picker, in the same order.
*   The pre-defined asset source `'ly.img.colors.defaultPalette'` contains the default color palette. Use this source ID to re-position or remove the default color palette.
*   To replace it (like we do in this example), create your custom asset source and update the entry to use it.

```
cesdk.ui.updateAssetLibraryEntry('ly.img.colors', {  sourceIds: ['myDefaultPalette']});
```

## Add custom library[#](#add-custom-library)

*   Next, use the asset API to add the asset source, then populate it with your preferred colors. See our guide on [Custom Color Libraries](nextjs/colors/create-color-palette-7012e0/) for more details.

```
// Add an asset source with your own colors:cesdk.engine.asset.addLocalSource('myDefaultPalette');cesdk.engine.asset.addAssetToSource('myDefaultPalette', {  id: 'red',  label: { en: 'red' },  tags: { en: ['red'] },  payload: {    color: {      colorSpace: 'sRGB',      r: 1,      g: 0,      b: 0    }  }});
```

## Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here’s the full code for configuring the default color palette:

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',  userId: 'guides-user',  ui: {    stylesheets: {      /* ... */    },    elements: {      /* ... */    }  }};
CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk_container', config).then(async (cesdk) => {  // Set the UI scale using the new API method  cesdk.ui.setScale('normal');
  cesdk.i18n.setTranslations({    en: {      'libraries.myDefaultPalette.label': 'My Default Palette'    }  });
  // Do something with the instance of CreativeEditor SDK  // Populate the asset library with default / demo asset sources.  cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();  cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({    sceneMode: 'Design',    withUploadAssetSources: true  });
  // Add an asset source with your own colors:  cesdk.engine.asset.addLocalSource('myDefaultPalette');  cesdk.engine.asset.addAssetToSource('myDefaultPalette', {    id: 'red',    label: { en: 'red' },    tags: { en: ['red'] },    payload: {      color: {        colorSpace: 'sRGB',        r: 1,        g: 0,        b: 0      }    }  });
  // Configure the color library to use our custom palette  cesdk.ui.updateAssetLibraryEntry('ly.img.colors', {    sourceIds: ['myDefaultPalette']  });
  await cesdk.createDesignScene();});
```

# Canvas Menu

## Rearrange Components[#](#rearrange-components)

There are 6 APIs for getting, setting, updating, removing, and inserting components in the Canvas Menu.

The content of the Canvas Menu changes based on the current [edit mode](nextjs/concepts/edit-modes-1f5b6c/) (`'Transform'` (the default), `'Text'`, `'Crop'`, `'Trim'`, or a custom value), so all APIs accept an `orderContext` argument to specify the mode.

For example usage of these APIs, see also [Moving Existing Buttons](nextjs/user-interface/customization/rearrange-buttons-97022a/) or [Adding New Buttons](nextjs/user-interface/ui-extensions/add-new-button-74884d/) in the Guides section.

### Get the Current Order[#](#get-the-current-order)

```
cesdk.ui.getCanvasMenuOrder(  orderContext: OrderContext = { editMode: 'Transform' })
```

When omitting the `orderContext` parameter, the order for the `'Transform'` edit mode is returned, e.g.

```
cesdk.ui.getCanvasMenuOrder();// => [// {id: 'ly.img.group.enter.canvasMenu'},// {id: 'ly.img.group.select.canvasMenu'},// ...// ]
```

### Set a new Order[#](#set-a-new-order)

```
setCanvasMenuOrder(  canvasMenuOrder: (CanvasMenuComponentId | OrderComponent)[],  orderContext: OrderContext = { editMode: 'Transform' })
```

When omitting the `orderContext` parameter, the order is set for the default edit mode (`'Transform'`), e.g.:

```
// Sets the order for transform mode by defaultcesdk.ui.setCanvasMenuOrder(['my.component.for.transform.mode']);
```

### Update Components[#](#update-components)

```
updateCanvasMenuOrderComponent(  matcher: OrderComponentMatcher<OrderComponent<CanvasMenuComponentId>>,  update: CanvasMenuComponentId | Partial<OrderComponent<CanvasMenuComponentId>> | ((component: OrderComponent<CanvasMenuComponentId>) => Partial<OrderComponent<CanvasMenuComponentId>>),  orderContext?: OrderContext)
```

Updates existing components in the canvas menu. The matcher can be:

*   `'first'` or `'last'` - matches the first or last component
*   A number - matches the component at that index
*   A component ID string
*   A partial object describing the component to match
*   A function that receives the component and index, returning true if it matches

The update can be:

*   A new component ID string
*   A partial object with updated properties
*   A function that receives the current component and returns the updated one

Returns an object with the number of updated components and the updated order array.

```
// Replace the duplicate button with a custom duplicate componentcesdk.ui.updateCanvasMenuOrderComponent(  'ly.img.duplicate.canvasMenu',  'my-custom-duplicate-component',);
// Replace text edit controls with simplified versions for basic userscesdk.ui.updateCanvasMenuOrderComponent(  component => component.id === 'ly.img.text.edit.canvasMenu',  'my-simple-text-edit-component',);
```

### Remove Components[#](#remove-components)

```
removeCanvasMenuOrderComponent(  matcher: OrderComponentMatcher<OrderComponent<CanvasMenuComponentId>>,  orderContext?: OrderContext)
```

Removes components from the canvas menu. The matcher can be:

*   `'first'` or `'last'` - matches the first or last component
*   A number - matches the component at that index
*   A component ID string
*   A partial object describing the component to match
*   A function that receives the component and index, returning true if it matches

Returns an object with the number of removed components and the updated order array.

```
// Remove placeholder controls for simplified interfacecesdk.ui.removeCanvasMenuOrderComponent('ly.img.placeholder.canvasMenu');
// Remove all text editing controls for basic userscesdk.ui.removeCanvasMenuOrderComponent(component =>  component.id.includes('text'),);
// Remove group controls for single-element contextscesdk.ui.removeCanvasMenuOrderComponent({  id: 'ly.img.group.enter.canvasMenu',});
```

### Insert Components[#](#insert-components)

```
insertCanvasMenuOrderComponent(  matcher: OrderComponentMatcher<OrderComponent<CanvasMenuComponentId>>,  component: CanvasMenuComponentId | OrderComponent<CanvasMenuComponentId>,  location?: InsertOrderComponentLocation,  orderContext?: OrderContext)
```

Inserts new components into the canvas menu. The matcher can be:

*   `'first'` or `'last'` - matches the first or last component
*   A number - matches the component at that index
*   A component ID string
*   A partial object describing the component to match
*   A function that receives the component and index, returning true if it matches

The location can be:

*   `'before'` - Insert before the matched component
*   `'after'` - Insert after the matched component (default)
*   `'replace'` - Replace the matched component
*   `'asChild'` - Insert as a child of the matched component

Returns the updated canvas menu order array.

```
// Add a custom action after the duplicate buttoncesdk.ui.insertCanvasMenuOrderComponent(  'ly.img.duplicate.canvasMenu',  'my-custom-action-component',);
// Add a separator before the delete button for better organizationcesdk.ui.insertCanvasMenuOrderComponent(  'ly.img.delete.canvasMenu',  'ly.img.separator',  'before',);
// Replace the default replace button with a custom onecesdk.ui.insertCanvasMenuOrderComponent(  'ly.img.replace.canvasMenu',  'my-custom-replace-component',  'replace',);
```

## Canvas Menu Components[#](#canvas-menu-components)

The following lists the default Canvas Menu components available within CE.SDK.

Take special note of the “Feature ID” column. Most components can be hidden/disabled by disabling the corresponding feature using the Feature API.

Also note that many components are only rendered for the block types listed in the “Renders for” column, because their associated controls (e.g. font size) are only meaningful for specific kinds of blocks (e.g. text).

### Layout Helpers[#](#layout-helpers)

| Component ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ly.img.separator` | Adds a vertical separator (`<hr>` element) in the Canvas Menu.  
Separators follow some special layouting rules:  
\- If 2 or more separators end up next to each other (e.g. due to other components not rendering), **only 1** separator will be rendered.  
\- Separators that end up being the first or last element in the Canvas Menu will **not** be rendered.  
\- Separators directly adjacent _to the left side_ of a spacer (see below) will **not** be rendered. |

### Common Controls[#](#common-controls)

These components are useful for editing various different block types.

| Component ID | Description | Feature ID | Renders for |

### Text[#](#text)

These components are relevant for editing text blocks, and will only render when a text block is selected.

| Component ID | Description | Feature ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ly.img.text.edit.canvasMenu` | Edit button:  
Switches to text edit mode when pressed. | `ly.img.text.edit` |

# Canvas Bar

## Rearrange Components[#](#rearrange-components)

There are 6 APIs for getting, setting, updating, removing, and inserting components in the Canvas Bar.

The Canvas Bar can appear in 2 positions: At the top of the canvas, and at the bottom of the canvas. The APIs can get and set the content for both of these positions independently.

The content of the Canvas Bar changes based on the current [edit mode](nextjs/concepts/edit-modes-1f5b6c/) (`'Transform'` (the default), `'Text'`, `'Crop'`, `'Trim'`, or a custom value), so all APIs accept an `orderContext` argument to specify the mode.

For example usage of similar APIs, see also [Moving Existing Buttons](nextjs/user-interface/customization/rearrange-buttons-97022a/) or [Adding New Buttons](nextjs/user-interface/ui-extensions/add-new-button-74884d/) in the Guides section.

### Get the Current Order[#](#get-the-current-order)

```
getCanvasBarOrder(  position: 'top' | 'bottom',  orderContext: OrderContext = {    editMode: 'Transform'  })
```

When omitting the `orderContext` parameter, the order for the `'Transform'` edit mode is returned, e.g.

```
cesdk.ui.getCanvasBarOrder('bottom');// => [// {id: 'ly.img.settings.canvasBar'},// {id: 'ly.img.spacer'},// ...// ]
```

### Set a new Order[#](#set-a-new-order)

```
setCanvasBarOrder(  canvasBarOrder: (CanvasBarComponentId | OrderComponent)[],  position: 'top' | 'bottom',  orderContext: OrderContext = {    editMode: 'Transform'  })
```

When omitting the `orderContext` parameter, the order is set for the default edit mode (`'Transform'`), e.g.:

```
// Sets the order for transform mode by defaultcesdk.ui.setCanvasBarOrder('bottom', ['my.component.for.transform.mode']);
```

### Update Components[#](#update-components)

```
updateCanvasBarOrderComponent(  matcher: OrderComponentMatcher<OrderComponent<CanvasBarComponentId>>,  update: CanvasBarComponentId | Partial<OrderComponent<CanvasBarComponentId>> | ((component: OrderComponent<CanvasBarComponentId>) => Partial<OrderComponent<CanvasBarComponentId>>),  position: 'top' | 'bottom',  orderContext?: OrderContext)
```

Updates existing components in the canvas bar. The matcher can be:

*   `'first'` or `'last'` - matches the first or last component
*   A number - matches the component at that index
*   A component ID string
*   A partial object describing the component to match
*   A function that receives the component and index, returning true if it matches

The update can be:

*   A new component ID string
*   A partial object with updated properties
*   A function that receives the current component and returns the updated one

Returns an object with the number of updated components and the updated order array.

```
// Replace the settings button with a custom settings componentcesdk.ui.updateCanvasBarOrderComponent(  'ly.img.settings.canvasBar',  'my-custom-settings-component',  'bottom',);
// Replace the add page button with a custom page management componentcesdk.ui.updateCanvasBarOrderComponent(  component => component.id === 'ly.img.page.add.canvasBar',  'my-custom-page-component',  'top',);
```

### Remove Components[#](#remove-components)

```
removeCanvasBarOrderComponent(  matcher: OrderComponentMatcher<OrderComponent<CanvasBarComponentId>>,  position: 'top' | 'bottom',  orderContext?: OrderContext)
```

Removes components from the canvas bar. The matcher can be:

*   `'first'` or `'last'` - matches the first or last component
*   A number - matches the component at that index
*   A component ID string
*   A partial object describing the component to match
*   A function that receives the component and index, returning true if it matches

Returns an object with the number of removed components and the updated order array.

```
// Remove the add page button for single-page documentscesdk.ui.removeCanvasBarOrderComponent('ly.img.page.add.canvasBar', 'bottom');
// Remove all settings controls for basic userscesdk.ui.removeCanvasBarOrderComponent(  component => component.id.includes('settings'),  'top',);

```

## Canvas Bar Components[#](#canvas-bar-components)

The following lists the default Canvas Bar components available within CE.SDK.

### Layout Helpers[#](#layout-helpers)

| Component ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ly.img.separator` | Adds a vertical separator (`<hr>` element) in the Canvas Bar.  
Separators follow some special layouting rules:  
\- If 2 or more separators end up next to each other (e.g. due to other components not rendering), **only 1** separator will be rendered.  
\- Separators that end up being the first or last element in the Canvas Bar will **not** be rendered.  
\- Separators directly adjacent _to the left side_ of a spacer (see below) will **not** be rendered. |
| `ly.img.spacer` | Adds horizontal spacing in the Canvas Bar.  
Spacers will try to fill all available whitespace, by distributing the available space between all spacers found in the Canvas Bar. |

### Common Controls[#](#common-controls)

| Component ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ly.img.settings.canvasBar` | Customize Editor button:  
Opens the Settings Panel when pressed. |
| `ly.img.page.add.canvasBar` | Add Page button:  
Adds a new page to the end of the document when pressed. |

## Default Order[#](#default-order)

The default order of the Canvas Bar is the following:

```
[  'ly.img.settings.canvasBar',  'ly.img.spacer',  'ly.img.page.add.canvasBar',  'ly.img.spacer',];
```

# Theming

Theming involves adjusting the colors, fonts, and sizes of the Editor UI. We have provisioned three levels of support for themes:

1.  Our built-in themes can be used out-of-the-box.
2.  Our theme generator can be used for quickly generating new themes based on three main colors
3.  A custom theme can be added by leveraging our theming API for the most detailed customization of our UI.

## Using the built-in Themes and Scale[#](#using-the-built-in-themes-and-scale)

We provide three built-in theme options and three scale settings that can be configured at runtime:

### Theme Management[#](#theme-management)

Use the following methods to manage themes at runtime:

*   `cesdk.ui.setTheme(theme)` - Sets the theme to ‘light’, ‘dark’, or ‘system’ (which follows the OS preference)
*   `cesdk.ui.getTheme()` - Returns the current theme (‘light’ or ‘dark’)

By default, the ‘light’ theme is active. The ‘system’ option automatically adapts to the user’s OS theme preference.

### Scale Management[#](#scale-management)

Use the following methods to manage UI scale at runtime:

*   `cesdk.ui.setScale(scale)` - Sets the UI scale to ‘normal’, ‘large’, ‘modern’, or a function that returns one of these values
*   `cesdk.ui.getScale()` - Returns the current scale setting

The scale modes offer different visual experiences:

*   **`normal`**: Standard UI scaling for desktop and larger screens
*   **`large`**: Increased UI element sizes, margins, and fonts for improved readability and accessibility, particularly beneficial for users with visual or motor impairments and those on small screens
*   **`modern`**: Modern theme with refined color palette, unified elevation surfaces, and improved visual hierarchy

For more flexibility, a callback can be passed that returns ‘normal’, ‘large’, or ‘modern’ based on viewport properties:

*   `containerWidth` - The width of the HTML element containing the CE.SDK editor
*   `isTouch` - Boolean indicating if the user agent supports touch input

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',  userId: 'guides-user',  baseURL: 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-js/1.63.0/assets'};
CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk_container', config).then(async (cesdk) => {  // Set theme at runtime (can be 'light', 'dark', or 'system')  cesdk.ui.setTheme('light');
  // Set scale dynamically based on viewport  cesdk.ui.setScale(({ containerWidth, isTouch }) => {    if (containerWidth < 600 || isTouch) {      return 'large';    } else {      return 'normal';    }  });  // Or simply set a fixed scale:  // cesdk.ui.setScale('normal');  // cesdk.ui.setScale('large');  // cesdk.ui.setScale('modern');
  // Get the current theme  const currentTheme = cesdk.ui.getTheme(); // 'light' or 'dark'
  // Get the current scale setting  const currentScale = cesdk.ui.getScale(); // 'normal', 'large', 'modern', or function
  // Populate the asset library with default / demo asset sources.  cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();  cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({    sceneMode: 'Design',    withUploadAssetSources: true  });  await cesdk.createDesignScene();});
```

## Using the Theme Generator[#](#using-the-theme-generator)

In order to get started quickly with building a custom theme, use our built-in theme generator found in the ‘Settings’ panel. Using only three base colors, this will generate a theme file that you can directly use. See Theming API below on how to provide your theme.

```
elements: {  panels: {    settings: true;  }}
```

## Using a Custom Theme[#](#using-a-custom-theme)

To provide a theme to the editor, link your themes `index.css` files or populate a `<style>` tag on the same page that includes the editor.

💡 We suggest to provide one `light` and one `dark` theme for the best possible user experience.

💡 We suggest to allow users to switch between `normal`, `large`, and `modern` scale options, and to build your themes so that the desired scaling is taken into account.

```

## Theming API[#](#theming-api)

Our theming API consists of several custom CSS properties, allowing you to adapt the look and feel of the editor to your needs.

To limit the scope of a theme to the CE.SDK Editor UI wrap any CSS properties in the `ubq-public` class.

The CE.SDK Editor supports switching between `dark` and `light` mode UI, which is a popular default in current operating systems. To adjust your theme based on that switch, use the data attribute `data-ubq-theme`.

The CE.SDK Editor also supports switching between ‘normal’, ‘large’, and ‘modern’ scale modes. The data attribute `data-ubq-scale` contains information on which scaling is currently requested:

# Icons

Using our API, you can register your own icon sets for usage within the CE.SDK editor. The API is as follows:

## Add new Icon Set[#](#add-new-icon-set)

```
cesdk.ui.addIconSet(id: string, svgSprite: string)
```

The icon set is a string containing a SVG sprite with symbols. The id of each symbol is used to reference the icon in the editor. These ids need to start with a `@` to be recognized in the editor.

Please Note: The SVG sprite will be injected into the (shadow) DOM without any sanitization. Make sure to only use trusted sources to prevent e.g. XSS attacks. If you are unsure about the source of the sprite, consider using libraries like DOMPurify to sanitize the SVG string before adding it.

## Examples[#](#examples)

### Register an Icon Set[#](#register-an-icon-set)

Registering an SVG string with a single symbol might look like this:

```
cesdk.ui.addIconSet(  '@imgly/custom',  `    <svg>      <symbol        fill="none"        xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"        viewBox="0 0 16 16"        id="@some/icon/ZoomIn"      >        <path          fillRule="evenodd"          clipRule="evenodd"          d="M3 7.5C3 5.01472 5.01472 3 7.5 3C9.98528 3 12 5.01472 12 7.5C12 9.98528 9.98528 12 7.5 12C5.01472 12 3 9.98528 3 7.5ZM7.5 2C4.46243 2 2 4.46243 2 7.5C2 10.5376 4.46243 13 7.5 13C8.74835 13 9.89957 12.5841 10.8226 11.8833L10.9697 12.0303L12.4697 13.5303L13 14.0607L14.0607 13L13.5303 12.4697L12.0303 10.9697L11.8833 10.8226C12.5841 9.89957 13 8.74835 13 7.5C13 4.46243 10.5376 2 7.5 2ZM7 7V5H8V7H10V8H8V10H7V8H5V7H7Z"          fill="currentColor"          fillOpacity="0.9"        />      </symbol>    </svg>  `,);
```

### Replace a Dock Icon[#](#replace-a-dock-icon)

You could use your custom icon set to replace the “Image” icon of the default Dock:

```
cesdk.ui.setDockOrder(  cesdk.ui.getDockOrder().map(entry => {    if (entry.key === 'ly.img.image')      return {        ...entry,        icon: '@some/icon/ZoomIn', // Note the ID referencing the SVG symbol      };    else return entry;  }),);
```

### Use within a custom Component[#](#use-within-a-custom-component)

Using your new symbol in a [custom component](nextjs/user-interface/ui-extensions/register-new-component-b04a04/) is then done by referencing the symbol ID directly:

```
cesdk.ui.registerComponent('CustomIcon', ({ builder: { Button } }) => {  Button('customIcon', {    label: 'Custom Icon',    icon: '@some/icon/ZoomIn', // Note the ID referencing the SVG symbol    onClick: () => {      console.log('Custom Icon clicked');    },  });});
```

## Built-In Icons[#](#built-in-icons)

These built-in icons can be referenced by their name string directly:

# Proxy Server

For security reasons, you should never include your AI service API keys directly in client-side code. Instead, you should set up proxy services that securely forward requests to AI providers while keeping your API keys secure on the server side.

Each AI provider configuration requires a `proxyUrl` parameter, which should point to your server-side endpoint that handles authentication and forwards requests to the AI service:

```
text2image: FalAiImage.RecraftV3({    proxyUrl: 'http://your-proxy-server.com/api/proxy'});
// Or use Recraft20b with icon style support:// text2image: FalAiImage.Recraft20b({//     proxyUrl: 'http://your-proxy-server.com/api/proxy'// });
```

## Proxy Implementation Requirements[#](#proxy-implementation-requirements)

Your proxy should implement specific requirements for each AI service:

### 1\. Anthropic Proxy[#](#1-anthropic-proxy)

*   **Target URL**: `https://api.anthropic.com/`
*   **Authentication Header**: Add `X-Api-Key` header with your Anthropic API key
*   **Request Handling**: Forward request body as-is to Anthropic API
*   **Response Handling**: Remove `content-encoding` headers to handle compressed responses correctly

### 2\. fal.ai Proxy[#](#2-falai-proxy)

*   **Dynamic URL**: Use a special header called `x-fal-target-url` to determine the actual endpoint
*   **Authentication Header**: Add `Authorization: Key YOUR_FAL_KEY` header
*   **Request Forwarding**: Preserve the complete request body and query parameters
*   For more information on the requirements, refer to fal.ai’s [documentation](https://docs.fal.ai/model-endpoints/server-side/#the-proxy-formula).

### 3\. ElevenLabs Proxy[#](#3-elevenlabs-proxy)

*   **Target URL**: `https://api.elevenlabs.io/`
*   **Authentication Header**: Add `xi-api-key` header with your ElevenLabs API key
*   **Headers**: Add an `Accept: audio/mpeg` header for audio requests.
*   **Response Handling**: Remove `content-encoding` headers to handle compressed responses correctly

### 4\. OpenAI Proxy[#](#4-openai-proxy)

*   **Target URL**: `https://api.openai.com/v1/`
*   **Authentication Header**: Add `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` header
*   **Response Handling**: Remove `content-encoding` headers to handle compressed responses correctly
*   **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting based on your OpenAI plan tier (recommended)
*   For more information on the requirements, refer to OpenAI’s [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/debugging-requests)

## Important Information for All Proxies[#](#important-information-for-all-proxies)

**Response Streaming**

To handle large responses efficiently, response streaming should be enabled for all proxies. Common approaches include:

*   **Axios**: `responseType: 'stream'`
*   **Fetch API**: Access `response.body` as a `ReadableStream`
*   **Node.js native HTTP clients**: Use stream-based responses
*   **Other HTTP clients**: Check documentation for streaming support

## General Proxy Design[#](#general-proxy-design)

A well-designed proxy service should:

1.  **Route requests** to the appropriate AI service based on the endpoint path
2.  **Add authentication** headers containing your API keys
3.  **Forward the request body** to maintain payload integrity
4.  **Handle response streaming** for services that support it (like Anthropic)
5.  **Implement proper CORS headers** to allow browser requests
6.  **Add appropriate error handling** and logging
7.  **Consider rate limiting** to protect your API keys from overuse

## Security Considerations[#](#security-considerations)

When implementing your proxy:

*   Store API keys securely as environment variables
*   Implement request validation to prevent abuse
*   Consider adding user authentication to your proxy endpoints
*   Monitor usage to detect unusual patterns
*   Implement proper error handling without leaking sensitive information

This approach ensures your API keys remain secure while still allowing your application to utilize AI services. For a complete example of a proxy implementation, you can find various proxy templates online that can be adapted for your specific needs.

export default App;
```

## 3\. AI Provider Configuration[#](#3-ai-provider-configuration)

Each AI provider type serves a specific purpose and creates different types of content:

### Text Generation (Anthropic)[#](#text-generation-anthropic)

```
text2text: AnthropicProvider({    proxyUrl: 'http://your-proxy-server.com/api/proxy',    headers: {        'x-client-version': '1.0.0',        'x-request-source': 'cesdk-tutorial'    }});
```

The text provider enables capabilities like:

*   Improving writing quality
*   Fixing spelling and grammar
*   Making text shorter or longer
*   Changing tone (professional, casual, friendly)
*   Translating to different languages
*   Custom text transformations

### Image Generation[#](#image-generation)

#### Multiple Providers Configuration[#](#multiple-providers-configuration)

```
// Text-to-image generation with multiple providers for user selectiontext2image: [    FalAiImage.RecraftV3({        proxyUrl: 'http://your-proxy-server.com/api/proxy',        headers: {            'x-client-version': '1.0.0',            'x-request-source': 'cesdk-tutorial'        }    }),    // Alternative with icon style support    FalAiImage.Recraft20b({        proxyUrl: 'http://your-proxy-server.com/api/proxy',        headers: {            'x-client-version': '1.0.0',            'x-request-source': 'cesdk-tutorial'        }    }),    OpenAiImage.GptImage1.Text2Image({        proxyUrl: 'http://your-proxy-server.com/api/proxy',        headers: {            'x-api-key': 'your-key',            'x-request-source': 'cesdk-tutorial'        }    })],
// Image-to-image transformationimage2image: FalAiImage.GeminiFlashEdit({    proxyUrl: 'http://your-proxy-server.com/api/proxy',    headers: {        'x-client-version': '1.0.0',        'x-request-source': 'cesdk-tutorial'    }})
```

When multiple providers are configured, users will see a selection box to choose between them.

Image generation features include:

*   Creating images from text descriptions
*   Multiple style options (realistic, illustration, vector)
*   Various size presets and custom dimensions
*   Transforming existing images based on text prompts

### Video Generation[#](#video-generation)

#### Multiple Providers Configuration[#](#multiple-providers-configuration-1)

```
// Text-to-video generation with multiple providers for user selectiontext2video: [    FalAiVideo.MinimaxVideo01Live({        proxyUrl: 'http://your-proxy-server.com/api/proxy',        headers: {            'x-client-version': '1.0.0',            'x-request-source': 'cesdk-tutorial'        }    }),    FalAiVideo.PixverseV35TextToVideo({        proxyUrl: 'http://your-proxy-server.com/api/proxy',        headers: {            'x-client-version': '1.0.0',            'x-request-source': 'cesdk-tutorial'        }    })],
// Image-to-video transformationimage2video: FalAiVideo.MinimaxVideo01LiveImageToVideo({    proxyUrl: 'http://your-proxy-server.com/api/proxy',    headers: {        'x-client-version': '1.0.0',        'x-request-source': 'cesdk-tutorial'    }})
```

Video generation capabilities include:

*   Creating videos from text descriptions
*   Transforming still images into videos
*   Fixed output dimensions (typically 1280×720)
*   5-second video duration

### Audio Generation (ElevenLabs)[#](#audio-generation-elevenlabs)

```
// Text-to-speech generationtext2speech: Elevenlabs.ElevenMultilingualV2({    proxyUrl: 'http://your-proxy-server.com/api/proxy',    headers: {        'x-client-version': '1.0.0',        'x-request-source': 'cesdk-tutorial'    }}),
// Sound effect generationtext2sound: Elevenlabs.ElevenSoundEffects({    proxyUrl: 'http://your-proxy-server.com/api/proxy',    headers: {        'x-client-version': '1.0.0',        'x-request-source': 'cesdk-tutorial'    }})
```

Audio generation features include:

*   Text-to-speech with multiple voices
*   Multilingual support
*   Adjustable speaking speed
*   Sound effect generation from text descriptions
*   Creating ambient sounds and effects

## 4\. UI Integration[#](#4-ui-integration)

The AI Apps plugin registers several UI components to CreativeEditor SDK:

### AI Dock Button[#](#ai-dock-button)

The main entry point for AI features is the AI dock button, which you can position in the dock:

```
// Add the AI dock component to the beginning of the dockcesdk.ui.setDockOrder(['ly.img.ai.apps.dock', ...cesdk.ui.getDockOrder()]);
// Or add it at a specific positionconst currentOrder = cesdk.ui.getDockOrder();currentOrder.splice(2, 0, 'ly.img.ai.apps.dock');cesdk.ui.setDockOrder(currentOrder);
```

### Canvas Menu Options[#](#canvas-menu-options)

AI text and image transformations are available in the canvas context menu:

```
cesdk.ui.setCanvasMenuOrder([    'ly.img.ai.text.canvasMenu',    'ly.img.ai.image.canvasMenu',    ...cesdk.ui.getCanvasMenuOrder()]);
```

### AI Apps Menu[#](#ai-apps-menu)

In video mode, clicking the AI dock button shows cards for all available AI generation types. This menu automatically adjusts based on the available providers you’ve configured.

## 5\. Using Middleware[#](#5-using-middleware)

The AI generation framework supports middleware that can enhance or modify the generation process. Middleware functions are executed in sequence and can perform operations before generation, after generation, or both.

### Common Middleware Types[#](#common-middleware-types)

#### Upload Middleware[#](#upload-middleware)

The `uploadMiddleware` is useful when you need to store generated content on your server before it’s used:

```
import { uploadMiddleware } from '@imgly/plugin-ai-generation-web';
// In your provider configurationmiddleware: [  uploadMiddleware(async (output) => {    // Upload the output to your server    const response = await fetch('https://your-server.com/api/upload', {      method: 'POST',      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },      body: JSON.stringify({ url: output.url })    });
    const result = await response.json();
    // Return updated output with your server's URL    return {      ...output,      url: result.permanentUrl    };  })]
```

Use cases for upload middleware:

*   Storing generated assets in your own cloud storage
*   Adding watermarks or processing assets before use
*   Tracking/logging generated content
*   Implementing licensing or rights management

#### Rate Limiting Middleware[#](#rate-limiting-middleware)

To prevent abuse of AI services, you can implement rate limiting:

```
import { rateLimitMiddleware } from '@imgly/plugin-ai-generation-web';
// In your provider configurationmiddleware: [  rateLimitMiddleware({    maxRequests: 10,    timeWindowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour    onRateLimitExceeded: (input, options, info) => {      // Show a notice to the user      console.log(`Rate limit reached: ${info.currentCount}/${info.maxRequests}`);      return false; // Reject the request    }  })]
```

#### Custom Error Handling Middleware[#](#custom-error-handling-middleware)

You can create custom middleware for error handling:

```
const errorMiddleware = async (input, options, next) => {  try {    return await next(input, options);  } catch (error) {    // Handle error (show UI notification, log, etc.)    console.error('Generation failed:', error);    // You can rethrow or return a fallback    throw error;  }};
```

### Middleware Order[#](#middleware-order)

The order of middleware is important - they’re executed in the sequence provided:

```
middleware: [  // Executes first  rateLimitMiddleware({ maxRequests: 10, timeWindowMs: 3600000 }),
  // Executes second (only if rate limit wasn't exceeded)  loggingMiddleware(),
  // Executes third (after generation completes)  uploadMiddleware(async (output) => { /* ... */ })]
```

## 6\. Controlling Features with Feature API[#](#6-controlling-features-with-feature-api)

You can control which AI features are available to users using CE.SDK’s Feature API. This is useful for:

*   Creating different feature tiers for different user groups
*   Simplifying the UI by hiding unused features
*   Temporarily disabling features during maintenance

### Basic Feature Control[#](#basic-feature-control)

```
// Disable specific quick actionscesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.plugin-ai-image-generation-web.quickAction.editImage', false);cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.plugin-ai-text-generation-web.quickAction.translate', false);
// Control input types for image/video generationcesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.plugin-ai-image-generation-web.fromText', true);cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.plugin-ai-image-generation-web.fromImage', false);
// Hide provider selection dropdownscesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.plugin-ai-image-generation-web.providerSelect', false);
// Control style groups for specific providers (e.g., RecraftV3, Recraft20b)cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.plugin-ai-image-generation-web.fal-ai/recraft-v3.style.vector', false);cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.plugin-ai-image-generation-web.fal-ai/recraft/v2/text-to-image.style.icon', false);
```

For more details on available feature flags, see the [@imgly/plugin-ai-generation-web documentation](https://github.com/imgly/plugins/tree/main/packages/plugin-ai-generation-web#available-feature-flags).

## 7\. Proxy Server Configuration[#](#7-proxy-server-configuration)

For security reasons, you should never include your AI service API keys directly in client-side code. Instead, you should set up proxy services that securely forward requests to AI providers while keeping your API keys secure on the server side.

Each AI provider configuration requires a `proxyUrl` parameter, which should point to your server-side endpoint that handles authentication and forwards requests to the AI service:

```
text2image: FalAiImage.RecraftV3({    proxyUrl: 'http://your-proxy-server.com/api/proxy'});
// Or use Recraft20b with icon style support:// text2image: FalAiImage.Recraft20b({//     proxyUrl: 'http://your-proxy-server.com/api/proxy'// });
```

Your proxy server should handle authentication, forward requests to the appropriate AI service providers, and manage response streaming for optimal performance.

# Custom AI Provider

This tutorial will guide you through creating a custom AI-powered image generation provider for CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) using the `@imgly/plugin-ai-generation-web` package. You’ll learn how to implement an AI provider from scratch using the schema-based approach and how to seamlessly integrate sophisticated AI image generation capabilities with CE.SDK.

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites)

*   Basic knowledge of TypeScript and React
*   Familiarity with CreativeEditor SDK
*   An image generation API to integrate with

## 1\. Project Setup[#](#1-project-setup)

First, set up your project and install the necessary packages:

Terminal window

```
# Create a new project or use an existing onemkdir my-image-providercd my-image-provider
# Initialize package.jsonnpm init -y
# Install required dependenciesnpm install @imgly/plugin-ai-generation-web @cesdk/cesdk-js typescript
```

## 2\. Understanding the Provider Interface[#](#2-understanding-the-provider-interface)

The core of the AI generation system is the `Provider` interface. For image generation, we implement this interface with `kind: 'image'`.

Key components of an image provider:

*   **id**: Unique identifier for your provider
*   **kind**: Always ‘image’ for image generation
*   **initialize**: Setup function for any necessary configuration
*   **input**: Configuration for the input UI panel and parameters
*   **output**: Configuration for generation behavior and result handling

## 3\. Creating an OpenAPI Schema[#](#3-creating-an-openapi-schema)

For schema-based input, you need an OpenAPI schema that defines your input parameters. Create a file called `myApiSchema.json`:

```
{    "openapi": "3.0.0",    "info": {        "title": "My Image Generator API",        "version": "1.0.0"    },    "components": {        "schemas": {            "GenerationInput": {                "type": "object",                "required": ["prompt"],                "properties": {                    "prompt": {                        "type": "string",                        "title": "Description",                        "description": "Describe the image you want to generate",                        "x-imgly-builder": {                            "component": "TextArea"                        }                    },                    "width": {                        "type": "integer",                        "title": "Width",                        "default": 512,                        "enum": [256, 512, 768, 1024],                        "x-imgly-builder": {                            "component": "Select"                        }                    },                    "height": {                        "type": "integer",                        "title": "Height",                        "default": 512,                        "enum": [256, 512, 768, 1024],                        "x-imgly-builder": {                            "component": "Select"                        }                    },                    "style": {                        "type": "string",                        "title": "Style",                        "default": "photorealistic",                        "enum": [                            "photorealistic",                            "cartoon",                            "sketch",                            "painting"                        ],                        "x-imgly-builder": {                            "component": "Select"                        }                    }                },                "x-order-properties": ["prompt", "width", "height", "style"]            }        }    }}
```

## 4\. Understanding CommonProviderConfiguration[#](#4-understanding-commonproviderconfiguration)

Before creating your provider, it’s important to understand the `CommonProviderConfiguration` interface. This interface provides standardized configuration options that all providers should extend:

```
interface CommonProviderConfiguration<I, O extends Output> {    // The proxy URL to use for the provider    proxyUrl: string;
    // Enable debug mode for additional logging    debug?: boolean;
    // Middleware for request/response processing    middleware?: Middleware<I, O>[];
    // Custom headers to include in all API requests    headers?: Record<string, string>;
    // Override provider's default history asset source    history?: false | '@imgly/local' | '@imgly/indexedDB' | (string & {});
    // Configure supported quick actions    supportedQuickActions?: {        [quickActionId: string]: Partial<QuickActionSupport<I>> | false | null;    };
    // Configure default property values    properties?: PropertiesConfiguration;}
```

### Extended Configuration Options[#](#extended-configuration-options)

#### Headers Configuration[#](#headers-configuration)

The `headers` property is particularly useful for:

*   Adding custom client identification headers
*   Including version information
*   Passing through metadata required by your API
*   Adding correlation IDs for request tracing

#### History Configuration[#](#history-configuration)

The `history` property allows you to override the provider’s default history storage behavior:

*   `false`: Disable history storage entirely
*   `'@imgly/local'`: Use temporary local storage (not persistent across sessions)
*   `'@imgly/indexedDB'`: Use browser IndexedDB storage (persistent across sessions)
*   `string`: Use your own custom asset source ID

#### Quick Actions Configuration[#](#quick-actions-configuration)

The `supportedQuickActions` property allows you to customize which quick actions are supported and how they behave:

*   `false` or `null`: Remove the quick action entirely
*   `true`: Keep the provider’s default implementation
*   Object with `mapInput`: Override the quick action with custom input mapping
*   Object with other properties: Override with custom configuration

#### Property Configuration[#](#property-configuration)

The `properties` property allows you to define default values for any provider property:

*   Static values: Simple default values that apply to all users
*   Dynamic functions: Return values based on context (engine, cesdk, locale)
*   Context includes `engine`, `cesdk`, and `locale` for making informed decisions

## 5\. Creating a Schema-Based Image Provider[#](#5-creating-a-schema-based-image-provider)

**Important Note**: The tutorial below shows the legacy quick action structure using `actions` array. The current architecture uses the `supported` object with quick action IDs. The example has been updated to reflect the new structure.

Let’s create a simple provider that generates images by calling your API. Create a file called `MyImageProvider.ts`:

```
import {    Provider,    ImageOutput,    loggingMiddleware,    uploadMiddleware,    CommonProviderConfiguration} from '@imgly/plugin-ai-generation-web';import type CreativeEditorSDK from '@cesdk/cesdk-js';import apiSchema from './myApiSchema.json';
// Define your input type based on your schemainterface MyProviderInput {    prompt: string;    width: number;    height: number;    style: string;    image_url?: string; // For image-to-image operations}
// Define provider configuration interface extending CommonProviderConfigurationinterface MyProviderConfiguration extends CommonProviderConfiguration<MyProviderInput, ImageOutput> {    // Add any provider-specific configuration here    customApiKey?: string;}
// Create a function that returns your providerexport function MyImageProvider(config: MyProviderConfiguration): (context: {    cesdk: CreativeEditorSDK;}) => Promise<Provider<'image', MyProviderInput, ImageOutput>> {    // Return a function that returns the provider    return async ({ cesdk }) => {        // Create and return the provider        const provider: Provider<'image', MyProviderInput, ImageOutput> = {            // Unique identifier for your provider            id: 'my-image-provider',
            // Define output type as 'image'            kind: 'image',
            // Initialize your provider            initialize: async ({ engine, cesdk }) => {                console.log('Initializing my image provider');                // Any setup needed (e.g., API client initialization)            },
            // Define input panel and UI using schema            input: {                panel: {                    type: 'schema',                    document: apiSchema, // Your OpenAPI schema                    inputReference: '#/components/schemas/GenerationInput', // Reference to your input schema                    userFlow: 'placeholder', // Creates a block first, then updates it with the generated content                    orderExtensionKeyword: 'x-order-properties', // Used to control property display order
                    // Convert API input to block parameters                    getBlockInput: async (input) => ({                        image: {                            width: input.width || 512,                            height: input.height || 512,                            label: `AI: ${input.prompt?.substring(0, 20)}...`                        }                    })                },
                // Add quick actions for canvas menu                quickActions: {                    supported: {                        // Map quick action IDs to provider input transformations                        'ly.img.editImage': {                            mapInput: (quickActionInput) => ({                                prompt: quickActionInput.prompt,                                image_url: quickActionInput.uri,                                width: 512,                                height: 512,                                style: 'photorealistic'                            })                        },                        'ly.img.swapBackground': {                            mapInput: (quickActionInput) => ({                                prompt: quickActionInput.prompt,                                image_url: quickActionInput.uri,                                width: 512,                                height: 512,                                style: 'photorealistic'                            })                        },                        'ly.img.createVariant': {                            mapInput: (quickActionInput) => ({                                prompt: quickActionInput.prompt,                                image_url: quickActionInput.uri,                                width: 512,                                height: 512,                                style: 'photorealistic'                            })                        },                        'ly.img.styleTransfer': {                            mapInput: (quickActionInput) => ({                                prompt: quickActionInput.style,                                image_url: quickActionInput.uri,                                width: 512,                                height: 512,                                style: 'photorealistic'                            })                        }                    }                }            },

        return provider;    };}
```

## 6\. Integrating with CE.SDK[#](#6-integrating-with-cesdk)

Now let’s integrate your provider with CE.SDK using the `@imgly/plugin-ai-image-generation-web` package.

Create an `index.ts` file:

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from '@cesdk/cesdk-js';import ImageGeneration from '@imgly/plugin-ai-image-generation-web';import { MyImageProvider } from './MyImageProvider';
// Initialize the editorasync function initializeEditor(container: HTMLElement) {    const cesdk = await CreativeEditorSDK.create(container, {        license: 'your-cesdk-license-key'    });
    // Add default asset sources    await cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();
    // Add your image generation provider    cesdk.addPlugin(        ImageGeneration({            text2image: MyImageProvider({                proxyUrl: 'http://your-proxy-server.com/api/proxy',                headers: {                    'x-client-version': '1.0.0',                    'x-request-source': 'cesdk-tutorial',                    'x-api-key': 'your-api-key'                },                customApiKey: 'your-custom-key'            }),            debug: true        })    );
    // Create a design scene    await cesdk.createDesignScene();
    // Add the dock component to open the AI image generation panel    cesdk.ui.setDockOrder([      'ly.img.ai.image-generation.dock',      ...cesdk.ui.getDockOrder()    ]);
    return cesdk;}
// Start the editor when the DOM is loadeddocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {    const container = document.getElementById('cesdk-container');    if (container) {        initializeEditor(container);    }});
```

## 7\. Create an HTML Page[#](#7-create-an-html-page)

Create an `index.html` file to host your editor:

```
<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en">    <head>        <meta charset="UTF-8" />        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />        <title>AI Image Generation with CE.SDK</title>        <style>            body,            html {                margin: 0;                padding: 0;                height: 100%;                width: 100%;                overflow: hidden;            }            #cesdk-container {                width: 100%;                height: 100vh;            }        </style>    </head>    <body>        <div id="cesdk-container"></div>        <script src="./dist/index.js"></script>    </body></html>
```

## 8\. Build and Run the Example[#](#8-build-and-run-the-example)

Let’s set up a complete build and run process using esbuild. Note that you’re free to use whatever build setup you’re most comfortable with (webpack, Vite, Parcel, etc.) - the following is just an example to get you started quickly.

### Setting up TypeScript[#](#setting-up-typescript)

Create a basic TypeScript configuration:

Terminal window

```
# Create a tsconfig.json filenpx tsc --init
```

Edit the generated `tsconfig.json` to include these recommended settings:

```
{    "compilerOptions": {        "target": "ES2020",        "module": "ESNext",        "moduleResolution": "node",        "esModuleInterop": true,        "strict": true,        "skipLibCheck": true,        "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,        "resolveJsonModule": true,        "outDir": "./dist",        "jsx": "react"    },    "include": ["src/**/*"],    "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]}
```

### Setting up esbuild[#](#setting-up-esbuild)

Install esbuild as a development dependency:

Terminal window

```
npm install --save-dev esbuild
```

Create a build script in your `package.json`:

```
{    "name": "my-image-provider",    "version": "1.0.0",    "scripts": {        "build": "esbuild index.ts --bundle --outfile=dist/index.js --platform=browser",        "dev": "esbuild index.ts --bundle --outfile=dist/index.js --platform=browser --watch --servedir=."    },    "dependencies": {        "@cesdk/cesdk-js": "^1.48.0",        "@imgly/plugin-ai-generation-web": "^0.1.0",        "@imgly/plugin-ai-image-generation-web": "^0.1.0"    },    "devDependencies": {        "esbuild": "^0.19.0",        "typescript": "^5.0.0"    }}
```

### Project Structure[#](#project-structure)

Make sure your files are organized as follows:

```
my-image-provider/├── index.html├── index.ts├── MyImageProvider.ts├── myApiSchema.json├── package.json└── tsconfig.json
```

### Running the Example[#](#running-the-example)

Now you can build and run your example:

Terminal window

```
# For production buildnpm run build
# For development with live reloadnpm run dev
```

If you use `npm run dev`, esbuild will start a development server and you can view your project at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Alternatively, you can use any static file server after building:

Terminal window

```
# Using serve (you might need to install it first with: npm install -g serve)serve
# Or with Python's built-in HTTP serverpython -m http.server
# Or with PHP's built-in serverphp -S localhost:8000
```

### Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting)

If you encounter issues:

1.  Check browser console for errors
2.  Verify that your API endpoint is correctly configured
3.  Make sure the CE.SDK license key is valid
4.  Check that all dependencies are installed correctly

Remember that this build setup is just an example - feel free to adapt it to your existing workflow or preferred build tools. The key components are:

1.  TypeScript compilation
2.  Bundling your code
3.  Serving the HTML and bundled JavaScript

## Conclusion[#](#conclusion)

You’ve now created a custom image generation provider for CE.SDK using the schema-based approach! Your provider integrates with the AI image generation plugin and provides a seamless user experience for generating images.

The schema-based approach offers several advantages:

*   Automatic UI generation based on your schema
*   Built-in validation of input parameters
*   Consistent UI experience that matches the CE.SDK style
*   Easy ordering of properties using the `x-order-properties` extension

### Updated Architecture Features[#](#updated-architecture-features)

The new architecture includes:

*   **Quick Action Registry**: Uses `supported` object with action IDs instead of action arrays
*   **Custom Headers**: All providers support headers configuration for API requests
*   **Enhanced Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript support with better provider interfaces
*   **Cross-plugin Support**: Actions can work across different AI generation plugins

### Custom Error Handling with preventDefault()[#](#custom-error-handling-with-preventdefault)

Middleware can suppress default UI feedback behaviors using `options.preventDefault()`. This is useful when you want complete control over how errors and successes are presented to users:

**What gets prevented:**

*   Error/success notifications (toast messages)
*   Block error state (error icon)
*   Console error logging

**What is NOT prevented:**

*   Pending → Ready transition (loading spinner always stops)

**Example: Error-specific handling:**

```
const smartErrorMiddleware = async (input, options, next) => {  try {    return await next(input, options);  } catch (error) {    options.preventDefault();
    // Handle different error types with custom UI    if (error.message?.includes('rate limit')) {      options.cesdk?.ui.showDialog({        type: 'warning',        content: 'Rate limit reached. Please upgrade for more generations.',        actions: { label: 'Upgrade', onClick: () => window.open('/pricing') }      });    } else if (error.message?.includes('network')) {      options.cesdk?.ui.showNotification({        type: 'error',        message: 'Network error. Please check your connection.'      });    } else {      options.cesdk?.ui.showNotification({        type: 'error',        message: `Generation failed: ${error.message}`      });    }
    throw error;  }};
```

### Controlling Features with Feature API[#](#controlling-features-with-feature-api)

You can control which UI elements and features are available to users using CE.SDK’s Feature API:

```
// Disable provider selection dropdown if you only want one provider visiblecesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.plugin-ai-image-generation-web.providerSelect', false);
// Control input type visibility (for providers that support both text and image input)cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.plugin-ai-image-generation-web.fromText', true);cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.plugin-ai-image-generation-web.fromImage', false);
// Provider-specific style controls (e.g., for RecraftV3 or Recraft20b)cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.plugin-ai-image-generation-web.fal-ai/recraft-v3.style.vector', false);
```

Next steps:

1.  Explore more quick action IDs from the available list (editImage, swapBackground, createVariant, styleTransfer, etc.)
2.  Implement multiple providers with selection UI using provider arrays
3.  Add custom middleware for request/response processing
4.  Implement proper error handling and retry logic
5.  Add custom asset sources for generated images
6.  Use Feature API to customize the UI experience for different user groups

```

The CE.SDK provides a flexible way to create and customize shapes, including rectangles, circles, lines, and polygons.

## Supported Shapes[#](#supported-shapes)

The following shapes are supported in CE.SDK:

*   `'//ly.img.ubq/shape/rect'`
*   `'//ly.img.ubq/shape/line'`
*   `'//ly.img.ubq/shape/ellipse'`
*   `'//ly.img.ubq/shape/polygon'`
*   `'//ly.img.ubq/shape/star'`
*   `'//ly.img.ubq/shape/vector_path'`

Note: short types are also accepted, e.g. ‘rect’ instead of ‘//ly.img.ubq/shape/rect’.

## Creating Shapes[#](#creating-shapes)

`graphic` blocks don’t have any shape after you create them, which leaves them invisible by default. In order to make them visible, we need to assign both a shape and a fill to the `graphic` block. You can find more information on fills [here](nextjs/fills-402ddc/). In this example we have created and attached an image fill.

In order to create a new shape, we must call the `createShape(type: string): number` API.

```
const rectShape = engine.block.createShape('rect');
```

In order to assign this shape to the `graphic` block, call the `setShape(id: number, shape: number): void` API.

```
engine.block.setShape(graphic, rectShape);
```

Just like design blocks, shapes with different types have different properties that you can set via the API. Please refer to the [API docs](nextjs/stickers-and-shapes/create-edit/edit-shapes-d67cfb/) for a complete list of all available properties for each type of shape.

## Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here’s the full code:

```
import CreativeEngine from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',  userId: 'guides-user',  baseURL:    'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/assets',};
CreativeEngine.init(config).then(async engine => {  document.getElementById('cesdk_container').append(engine.element);
  const scene = engine.scene.create();  engine.editor.setSetting('page/dimOutOfPageAreas', false);
  const graphic = engine.block.create('graphic');  const imageFill = engine.block.createFill('image');  engine.block.setString(    imageFill,    'fill/image/imageFileURI',    'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1.jpg',  );  engine.block.setFill(graphic, imageFill);  engine.block.setWidth(graphic, 100);  engine.block.setHeight(graphic, 100);  engine.block.appendChild(scene, graphic);
  engine.scene.zoomToBlock(graphic, 40, 40, 40, 40);
  engine.block.supportsShape(graphic); // Returns true  engine.block.supportsShape(text); // Returns false});
```

```

The `graphic` [design block](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/) in CE.SDK allows you to modify and replace its shape. CreativeEditor SDK supports many different types of shapes, such as rectangles, lines, ellipses, polygons and custom vector paths.

Similarly to blocks, each shape object has a numeric id which can be used to query and [modify its properties](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/).

## Accessing Shapes[#](#accessing-shapes)

In order to query whether a block supports shapes, you should call the `supportsShape(id: number): boolean` API. Currently, only the `graphic` design block supports shape objects.

```
engine.block.supportsShape(graphic); // Returns trueconst text = engine.block.create('text');engine.block.supportsShape(text); // Returns false
```

To query the shape id of a design block, call the `getShape(id: number): number` API. You can now pass this id into other APIs in order to query more information about the shape, e.g. its type via the `getType(id: number): string` API.

```
const shape = engine.block.getShape(graphic);const shapeType = engine.block.getType(shape);
```

When replacing the shape of a design block, remember to destroy the previous shape object if you don’t intend to use it any further. Shape objects that are not attached to a design block will never be automatically destroyed.

Destroying a design block will also destroy its attached shape block.

```
const starShape = engine.block.createShape('star');engine.block.destroy(engine.block.getShape(graphic));engine.block.setShape(graphic, starShape);/* The following line would also destroy the currently attached starShape */// engine.block.destroy(graphic);
```

## Shape Properties[#](#shape-properties)

Just like design blocks, shapes with different types have different properties that you can query and modify via the API. Use `findAllProperties(id: number): string[]` in order to get a list of all properties of a given shape.

For the star shape in this example, the call would return `['name', 'shape/star/innerDiameter', 'shape/star/points', 'type', 'uuid']`.

Please refer to the [API docs](nextjs/stickers-and-shapes/create-edit/edit-shapes-d67cfb/) for a complete list of all available properties for each type of shape.

```
const allShapeProperties = engine.block.findAllProperties(starShape);
```

Once we know the property keys of a shape, we can use the same APIs as for design blocks in order to modify those properties. For example, we can use `setInt(id: number, property: string, value: number): void` in order to change the number of points of the star to six.

```
engine.block.setInt(starShape, 'shape/star/points', 6);
```

## Full Code[#](#full-code)

Here’s the full code:

```
import CreativeEngine from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: 'YOUR_CESDK_LICENSE_KEY',  userId: 'guides-user',  baseURL:    'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/assets',};
CreativeEngine.init(config).then(async engine => {  document.getElementById('cesdk_container').append(engine.element);
  const scene = engine.scene.create();  engine.editor.setSetting('page/dimOutOfPageAreas', false);
  const graphic = engine.block.create('graphic');  const imageFill = engine.block.createFill('image');  engine.block.setString(    imageFill,    'fill/image/imageFileURI',    'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1.jpg',  );  engine.block.setFill(graphic, imageFill);  engine.block.setWidth(graphic, 100);  engine.block.setHeight(graphic, 100);  engine.block.appendChild(scene, graphic);
  engine.scene.zoomToBlock(graphic, 40, 40, 40, 40);
  engine.block.supportsShape(graphic); // Returns true  const text = engine.block.create('text');  engine.block.supportsShape(text); // Returns false
  const rectShape = engine.block.createShape('rect');  engine.block.setShape(graphic, rectShape);  const shape = engine.block.getShape(graphic);  const shapeType = engine.block.getType(shape);

In this example, we will show you how to integrate your custom asset sources into [CE.SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk).

With CE.SDK you can directly add external image providers like Unsplash or your own backend. A third option we will explore in this guide is using the engine’s Asset API directly. Follow along with this example while we are going to add the Unsplash library.

Adding an asset source is done creating an asset source definition and adding it using `asset.addSource(source: AssetSource)`. The asset source needs a unique identifier as part of an object implementing the interface of the source. All Asset API methods require the asset source’s unique identifier.

```
const customSource = {  id: 'unsplash',  findAssets: findUnsplashAssets,  credits: {    name: 'Unsplash',    url: 'https://unsplash.com/'  },  license: {    name: 'Unsplash license (free)',    url: 'https://unsplash.com/license'  }};
```

The most important function to implement is `findAssets(query: AssetQueryData): AssetQueryResult`. With this function alone you can define the complete asset source. It receives the asset query as an argument and returns a promise with the results.

*   The argument is the `queryData` and describes the slice of data the engine wants to use. This includes a query string and pagination information.
*   The result of this query is a promise that, besides the actual asset data, returns information like the current page, the next page and the total number of assets available for this specific query.

Returning a promise gives us great flexibility since we are completely agnostic of how we want to get the assets. We can use `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest` or import a library to return a result.

```
const findUnsplashAssets = async (queryData) => {
```

Let us implement an Unsplash asset source. Please note that this is just for demonstration purposes only and may not be ideal if you want to integrate Unsplash in your production environment.

We will use the official `unsplash-js` library to query the Unsplash API ([Link to Github page](https://github.com/unsplash/unsplash-js)). According to their documentation and guidelines, we have to create an access key and use a proxy to query the API, but this is out of scope for this example. Take a look at Unsplash’s documentation for further details.

```
const unsplashApi = unsplash.createApi({  apiUrl: '...'});
```

Unsplash has different API endpoints for different use cases. If we want to search we need to call a different endpoint as if we just want to display images without any search term.

Therefore we need to check if the query data contains a `query` string. If `findAssets` was called with a non-empty `query` we can call the asynchronous method `search.getPhotos`. As we can see in the example, we are passing the query arguments to this method.

*   `queryData.query`: The current search string from the search bar in the asset library.
*   `queryData.page`: For Unsplash specifically the requested page number starts with 1. We do not query all assets at once but by pages. As the user scrolls down more pages will be requested by calls to the `findAssets` method.
*   `queryData.perPage`: Determines how many assets we want to have included per page. This might change between calls. For instance, `perPage` can be called with a small number to display a small preview, but with a higher number e.g. if we want to show more assets in a grid view.

```
const response = await unsplashApi.search.getPhotos({  query: queryData.query,  page: unsplashPage,  perPage: queryData.perPage});
```

Once we receive the response and check for success we need to map Unsplash’s result to what the asset source API needs as a result. The CE.SDK expects an object with the following properties:

*   `assets`: An array of assets for the current query. We will take a look at what these have to look like in the next paragraph.
*   `total`: The total number of assets available for the current query. If we search for “Cat” with `perPage` set to 30, we will get 30 assets, but `total` likely will be a much higher number.
*   `currentPage`: Return the current page that was requested.
*   `nextPage`: This is the next page that can be requested after the current one. Should be `undefined` if there is no other page (no more assets). In this case we stop querying for more even if the user has scrolled to the bottom.

```
      const { results, total, total_pages } = response.response;
      return {        assets: await Promise.all(results.map(translateToAssetResult)),
        total,        currentPage: queryData.page,        nextPage:          queryData.page + 1 < total_pages ? queryData.page + 1 : undefined      };
```

Every image we get as a result of Unsplash needs to be translated into an object that is expected by the asset source API. We will describe every mandatory and optional property in the following paragraphs.

```
async function translateToAssetResult(image) {
```

`id`: The id of the asset (mandatory). This has to be unique for this source configuration.

```
id: image.id,
```

`locale` (optional): The language locale for this asset is used in `label` and `tags`.

```
locale: 'en',
```

`label` (optional): The label of this asset. It could be displayed in the tooltip as well as in the credits of the asset.

```
label: image.description ?? image.alt_description ?? undefined,
```

`tags` (optional): The tags of this asset. It could be displayed in the credits of the asset.

```
tags: image.tags ? image.tags.map((tag) => tag.title) : undefined,
```

`meta`: The meta object stores asset properties that depend on the specific asset type.

```
meta: {
```

`uri`: For an image asset this is the URL to the image file that will be used to add the image to the scene.

Note that we have to use the Unsplash API to obtain a usable URL at first.

```
uri: await getUnsplashUrl(image),
```

`thumbUri`: The URI of the asset’s thumbnail. It could be used in an asset library.

```
thumbUri: image.urls.thumb,
```

`blockType`: The type id of the design block that should be created when this asset is applied to the scene.

If omitted, CE.SDK will try to infer the block type from an optionally provided `mimeType` property (e.g. `image/jpeg`) or by loading the asset data behind `uri` and parsing the mime type from that. However, this will cause a delay before the asset can be added to the scene, which is why it is always recommended to specify the `blockType` upfront.

```
blockType: '//ly.img.ubq/graphic',
```

`fillType`: The type id of the fill that should be attached to the block when this asset is applied to the scene.

If omitted, CE.SDK will default to a solid color fill `//ly.img.ubq/fill/color`.

```
fillType: '//ly.img.ubq/fill/image',
```

`shapeType`: The type id of the shape that should be attached to the block when this asset is applied to the scene.

If omitted, CE.SDK will default to a rect shape `//ly.img.ubq/shape/rect`.

```
shapeType: '//ly.img.ubq/shape/rect',
```

`kind`: The kind that should be set to the block when this asset is applied to the scene.

If omitted, CE.SDK will default to an empty string.

```
kind: 'image',
```

`width`: The original width of the image.

`height`: The original height of the image.

```
width: image.width,height: image.height
```

`looping`: Determines whether the asset allows looping (applicable only to Video and GIF). When set to `true`, the asset can extend beyond its original length by looping for the specified duration. Default is set to `false`.

`context`: Adds contextual information to the asset. Right now, this only includes the source id of the source configuration.

```
context: {  sourceId: 'unsplash'},
```

`credits` (optional): Some image providers require to display credits to the asset’s artist. If set, it has to be an object with the artist’s `name` and a `url` to the artist page.

```
credits: artistName  ? {      name: artistName,      url: artistUrl    }  : undefined,
```

`utm` (optional): Some image providers require to add UTM parameters to all links to the source or the artist. If set, it contains a string to the `source` (added as `utm_source`) and the `medium` (added as `utm_medium`)

```
utm: {  source: 'CE.SDK Demo',  medium: 'referral'}
```

After translating the asset to match the interface from the asset source API, the array of assets for the current page can be returned.

In case, we’ve encountered an error, we need to reject the promise. Since we use the async/await language feature this means throwing a new error.

```
throw new Error(response.errors.join('. '));
```

An empty result can be returned instead of the result object if for some reason it does not make sense to throw an error but just show an empty result.

```
return Promise.resolve(EMPTY_RESULT);
```

Going further with our Unsplash integration we need to handle the case when no query was provided. Unsplash requires us to call a different API endpoint (`photos.list`) with slightly different parameters but the basics are the same. We need to check for success, calculate `total` and `nextPage` and translate the assets.

```
    const response = await unsplashApi.photos.list({      orderBy: 'popular',      page: unsplashPage,      perPage: queryData.perPage    });
    if (response.type === 'success') {      const { results, total } = response.response;      const totalFetched = queryData.page * queryData.perPage + results.length;
      const nextPage = totalFetched < total ? queryData.page + 1 : undefined;
      return {        assets: await Promise.all(results.map(translateToAssetResult)),
        total,        currentPage: queryData.page,        nextPage      };    } else if (response.type === 'error') {      throw new Error(response.errors.join('. '));    } else {      return Promise.resolve(EMPTY_RESULT);    }
```

We have already seen that an asset can define credits for the artist. Depending on the image provider you might need to add credits and the license for the source. In case of Unsplash, this includes a link as well as the license of all assets from this source.

```
credits: {  name: 'Unsplash',  url: 'https://unsplash.com/'},license: {  name: 'Unsplash license (free)',  url: 'https://unsplash.com/license'}
```

## Local Asset Sources[#](#local-asset-sources)

In many cases, you already have various finite sets of assets that you want to make available via asset sources. In order to save you the effort of having to implement custom asset query callbacks for each of these asset sources, CE.SDK also allows you to create “local” asset sources, which are managed by the engine and provide search and pagination functionalities.

In order to add such a local asset source, simply call the `addLocalSource` API and choose a unique id with which you can later access the asset source.

```
const localSourceId = 'background-videos';engine.asset.addLocalSource(localSourceId);
```

The `addAssetToSource(sourceId: string, asset: AssetDefinition): void` API allows you to add new asset instances to your local asset source. The local asset source then keeps track of these assets and returns matching items as the result of asset queries. Asset queries return the assets in the same order in which they were inserted into the local asset source.

Note that the `AssetDefinition` type that we pass to the `addAssetToSource` API is slightly different than the `AssetResult` type which is returned by asset queries. The `AssetDefinition` for example contains all localizations of the labels and tags of the same asset whereas the `AssetResult` is specific to the locale property of the query.

```
engine.asset.addAssetToSource(localSourceId, {  id: 'ocean-waves-1',  label: {    en: 'relaxing ocean waves',    es: 'olas del mar relajantes'  },  tags: {    en: ['ocean', 'waves', 'soothing', 'slow'],    es: ['mar', 'olas', 'calmante', 'lento']  },  meta: {    uri: `https://example.com/ocean-waves-1.mp4`,    thumbUri: `https://example.com/thumbnails/ocean-waves-1.jpg`,    mimeType: 'video/mp4',    width: 1920,    height: 1080  },  credits: {    name: 'John Doe',    url: 'https://example.com/johndoe'  }});
```

# From IMG.LY Premium Assets

This guide explains how to integrate and serve [premium templates from IMG.LY](https://img.ly/templates) in your application using the provided asset archive. The premium template package contains the following structure:

1.  **`content.json`**: An index file listing all the template assets that can be loaded into CE.SDK.
2.  Directories for each template containing the following:
    1.  **`asset.json`**: A manifest file containing metadata about the template.
    2.  **`thumbnail.jpg`**: A preview image of the template.
    3.  **`design.zip`**: A CE.SDK archive file also containing all associated assets.

Here’s a step-by-step tutorial to set up and use these templates.

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites)

1.  Ensure you have a self-hosted server to host the asset files.
2.  Have a working CE.SDK instance integrated into your application.

## Steps to Serve Premium Templates[#](#steps-to-serve-premium-templates)

### Organize and Host Assets[#](#organize-and-host-assets)

Unzip the provided archive and upload the folders (`ecommerce-retro-story-n99`, etc.) to your hosting server. Ensure the following files are hosted:

*   `asset.json`
*   `thumbnail.jpg`
*   `design.zip`

A manifest file listing all templates and their meta data:

*   `content.json`

These files should be accessible via URLs (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/assets/ecommerce-retro-story-n99/`).

### Configure CE.SDK[#](#configure-cesdk)

Update your CE.SDK configuration to serve templates from your hosted assets.

Example Configuration:

```
const config = {  baseURL: 'https://yourdomain.com/assets', // Your hosting URL base path};
let contentJSON = await fetch(  'https://yourdomain.com/assets/templates/content.json',).then(res => res.json());
CreativeEngine.init(config).then(engine => {  loadAssetSourceFromContentJSON(    engine,    contentJSON,    'https://yourdomain.com/assets/templates',  );});
```

This configuration tells CE.SDK to fetch templates and resources from your server.

### Load Templates from `content.json`[#](#load-templates-from-contentjson)

Use the `content.json` file to load templates into CE.SDK:

```
import { AssetDefinition, AssetResult, CreativeEngine } from '@cesdk/cesdk-js';
async function loadAssetSourceFromContentJSON(  engine: CreativeEngine,  content: ContentJSON,  baseURL = '',  applyAsset?: ((asset: AssetResult) => Promise<number | undefined>) | undefined) {  const { assets, id: sourceId } = content;
  engine.asset.addLocalSource(sourceId, undefined, applyAsset);  assets.forEach((asset) => {    if (asset.meta) {      Object.entries(asset.meta).forEach(([key, value]: [any, any]) => {        const stringValue: string = value.toString();        if (stringValue.includes('{{base_url}}')) {          const updated = stringValue.replace('{{base_url}}', baseURL);          if (asset.meta) {            asset.meta[key] = updated;          }        }      });    }
    if (asset.payload?.sourceSet) {      asset.payload.sourceSet.forEach((sourceSet) => {        sourceSet.uri = sourceSet.uri.replace('{{base_url}}', baseURL);      });    }
    engine.asset.addAssetToSource(sourceId, asset);  });}export type ContentJSON = {  version: string,  id: string,  assets: AssetDefinition[]};
export default loadAssetSourceFromContentJSON;
```

### Test and Verify[#](#test-and-verify)

1.  Load your application.
2.  Ensure that the template thumbnails appear in the library.
3.  Select a template to verify it loads correctly into the editor.

## Additional Tips[#](#additional-tips)

*   **Cache templates**: Use CDN or caching mechanisms for faster load times.
*   **Secure your assets**: If assets are meant for authenticated users only, ensure they are protected with proper access controls.

This guide should get you started with integrating and serving IMG.LY premium templates in your application. If you encounter issues or have questions, refer to the CE.SDK [Customize The Asset Library](nextjs/serve-assets-b0827c/) or [contact support](https://img.ly/support).

# From Soundstripe

# IMG.LY CE.SDK Plugin Soundstripe[#](#imgly-cesdk-plugin-soundstripe)

This plugin provides integration with Soundstripe’s audio library, allowing you to search and use Soundstripe audio tracks directly within CE.SDK.

## Features[#](#features)

*   🎵 Search and browse Soundstripe’s audio library directly in CE.SDK
*   🔄 Automatic refresh of expired audio URIs
*   📦 Seamless integration with CE.SDK’s asset management system
*   🎨 Artist credits and metadata support

## Installation[#](#installation)

You can install the plugin via npm or a compatible package manager. Use the following commands to install the package:

Terminal window

```
pnpm add @imgly/plugin-soundstripe-web# oryarn add @imgly/plugin-soundstripe-web# ornpm install @imgly/plugin-soundstripe-web
```

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites)

### 1\. Soundstripe API Key[#](#1-soundstripe-api-key)

You’ll need a valid Soundstripe API key. You can obtain one from [Soundstripe](https://soundstripe.com/).

### 2\. Proxy Server Setup (Required)[#](#2-proxy-server-setup-required)

**⚠️ Important:** Soundstripe’s API requires server-side proxy implementation for production use. Direct browser access to Soundstripe’s API is intended for development only.

You must set up a proxy server as described in [Soundstripe’s integration guide](https://docs.soundstripe.com/docs/integrating-soundstripes-content-into-your-application). This proxy will:

*   Handle authentication securely
*   Prevent exposing your API key in client-side code
*   Ensure CORS compliance
*   Maintain stable API access

## Usage[#](#usage)

### Basic Setup[#](#basic-setup)

```
import CreativeEditorSDK from '@cesdk/cesdk-js';import SoundstripePlugin from '@imgly/plugin-soundstripe-web';
const config = {  // license: 'your-license-here',};
const cesdk = await CreativeEditorSDK.create(container, config);await cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();await cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({ sceneMode: 'Design' });
// Add the Soundstripe pluginawait cesdk.addPlugin(  SoundstripePlugin({    apiKey: 'your-soundstripe-api-key'  }));
// Verify the asset source is availableconsole.log(  `Available asset sources: ${cesdk.engine.asset.findAllSources().join(', ')}`);
await cesdk.createDesignScene();
```

### Adding Soundstripe to Audio Asset Library[#](#adding-soundstripe-to-audio-asset-library)

To make Soundstripe appear in the Audio asset library panel, update the audio entry to include the Soundstripe source:

```
// After adding the Soundstripe pluginawait cesdk.addPlugin(  SoundstripePlugin({    apiKey: 'your-soundstripe-api-key'  }));
// Add Soundstripe to the audio sourcescesdk.ui.updateAssetLibraryEntry('ly.img.audio', {  sourceIds: ({ currentIds }) => [...currentIds, 'ly.img.audio.soundstripe']});
// Now Soundstripe will appear in the Audio asset panel
```

### Automatic URI Refresh[#](#automatic-uri-refresh)

Soundstripe MP3 file URIs expire after a certain time period. This plugin automatically handles URI refresh to ensure your audio tracks continue to play without interruption. The refresh happens:

*   When a scene is loaded
*   When the block selection changes

You can also manually trigger a refresh using the exported utility function:

```
import { refreshSoundstripeAudioURIs } from '@imgly/plugin-soundstripe-web';
// Manually refresh all Soundstripe audio URIs in the current sceneawait refreshSoundstripeAudioURIs(cesdk.engine, { apiKey });
// Or when using a proxy serverawait refreshSoundstripeAudioURIs(cesdk.engine, {  baseUrl: 'https://your-proxy.com'});
```

## Configuration[#](#configuration)

### Plugin Configuration[#](#plugin-configuration)

The plugin can be configured in two ways depending on your setup:

#### Option 1: Direct API Access (Development)[#](#option-1-direct-api-access-development)

```
import SoundstripePlugin from '@imgly/plugin-soundstripe-web';
await cesdk.addPlugin(  SoundstripePlugin({    apiKey: 'your-soundstripe-api-key' // Your Soundstripe API key  }));
```

#### Option 2: Proxy Server (Production - Recommended)[#](#option-2-proxy-server-production---recommended)

```
import SoundstripePlugin from '@imgly/plugin-soundstripe-web';
await cesdk.addPlugin(  SoundstripePlugin({    baseUrl: 'https://your-proxy-server.com' // Your proxy server URL  }));
```

```

Other than having pre-recorded [video](nextjs/create-video-c41a08/) in your scene you can also have a live preview from a camera in the engine. This allows you to make full use of the engine’s capabilities such as [effects](nextjs/filters-and-effects-6f88ac/), [strokes](nextjs/outlines/strokes-c2e621/) and [drop shadows](nextjs/outlines/shadows-and-glows-6610fa/), while the preview integrates with the composition of your scene. Simply swap out the `VideoFill` of a block with a `PixelStreamFill`. This guide shows you how the `PixelStreamFill` can be used in combination with a camera.

We create a video scene with a single page. Then we create a `PixelStreamFill` and assign it to the page. To demonstrate the live preview capabilities of the engine we also apply an effect to the page.

```
import CreativeEngine from 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/index.js';
const config = {  // license: import.meta.env.VITE_CESDK_LICENSE,  userId: 'guides-user'  // baseURL: 'https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/1.63.0/assets'};
CreativeEngine.init(config).then(async (engine) => {  document.getElementById('cesdk_container').append(engine.element);
  engine.scene.createVideo();  const stack = engine.block.findByType('stack')[0];  const page = engine.block.create('page');  engine.block.appendChild(stack, page);
  const pixelStreamFill = engine.block.createFill('pixelStream');  engine.block.setFill(page, pixelStreamFill);
  engine.block.appendEffect(page, engine.block.createEffect('half_tone'));
```

## Orientation[#](#orientation)

To not waste expensive compute time by transforming the pixel data of the buffer itself, it’s often beneficial to apply a transformation during rendering and let the GPU handle this work much more efficiently. For this purpose the `PixelStreamFill` has an `orientation` property. You can use it to mirror the image or rotate it in 90° steps. This property lets you easily mirror an image from a front facing camera or rotate the image by 90° when the user holds a device sideways.

```
// Horizontal mirroringengine.block.setEnum(  pixelStreamFill,  'fill/pixelStream/orientation',  'UpMirrored');
```

## Camera[#](#camera)

We use the `MediaDevices.getUserMedia()` API to prompt the user for permission to use a media input video device. This can be a camera, video recording device, or a screen sharing service. To access frames of the `MediaStream` we create an HTML video element. Once the video meta data is available we adjust the page size to the match the video resolution and zoom the camera to include the entire page.

```
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true }).then(  (stream) => {    const video = document.createElement('video');    video.autoplay = true;    video.srcObject = stream;    video.addEventListener('loadedmetadata', () => {      engine.block.setWidth(page, video.videoWidth);      engine.block.setHeight(page, video.videoHeight);      engine.scene.zoomToBlock(page, 40, 40, 40, 40);
```

## Updating the Fill[#](#updating-the-fill)

We use the video’s `requestVideoFrameCallback` to update the contents of the `PixelStreamFill`. The callback is fired whenever a new video frame is available. We use the engine’s `setNativePixelBuffer` method to update the fill with the new video frame. This method is optimized to avoid unnecessary copies of the pixel data. The method accepts either an `HTMLVideoElement` or an `HTMLCanvasElement` as input.

```
const onVideoFrame = () => {  engine.block.setNativePixelBuffer(pixelStreamFill, video);  video.requestVideoFrameCallback(onVideoFrame);};video.requestVideoFrameCallback(onVideoFrame);
```

# Refresh Assets

In this example, we explain how to use the [`assetSourceContentsChanged` API](nextjs/import-media/concepts-5e6197/) to notify the engine that asset content has been updated after a specific action has been taken.

By default, the CreativeEditorSDK takes care of refreshing the asset library entries in most cases. For example, when uploading or deleting elements. In other cases, however, we might need to refresh the asset library on demand. An example would be a custom asset source that can be updated from outside the CreativeEditorSDK.

## API Signature[#](#api-signature)

The `assetSourceContentsChanged` API will notify the engine about the asset source update which in turn will update the asset library panel with the new items accordingly. It can be used like the following:

```
// To refetch a specific asset source, you can pass the ID of the asset source as a parametercesdk.engine.asset.assetSourceContentsChanged('ly.img.audio.upload');
```

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites)

*   [Get the latest stable version of **Node.js & NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
*   (Optional): [Get the latest stable version of **Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started)

## 1\. Add the CreativeEditorSDK to Your Project[#](#1-add-the-creativeeditorsdk-to-your-project)

Terminal window

```
npm install @cesdk/cesdk-js# oryarn add @cesdk/cesdk-js
```

Terminal window

```
npm install @cesdk/cesdk-js# oryarn add @cesdk/cesdk-js
```

## 2\. Configure a custom asset source[#](#2-configure-a-custom-asset-source)

We will take Cloudinary as an example by adding a custom asset source to the configuration. Check out the [Customize The Asset Library](nextjs/import-media/asset-panel/customize-c9a4de/) guide for detailed information about adding customizing the asset library.

```
const config = {  /* ...configuration options */  assetSources: {    'cloudinary-images': {      findAssets: () => {        /* fetch the images from Cloudinary to display in the asset panel */      },    },  },  ui: {    elements: {      libraries: {        insert: {          /* append the Cloudinary asset source to the image asset library entry */        },      },    },  },};
```

## 3\. Refresh the asset source when a new image is uploaded[#](#3-refresh-the-asset-source-when-a-new-image-is-uploaded)

Let’s consider that an image can be uploaded to Cloudinary from our application outside of the context of the CreativeEditorSDK. In this case, we can use the `assetSourceContentsChanged` API to refresh the `cloudinary-images` asset source and update the asset panel with the new items.

```
CreativeEditorSDK.create(config).then(async cesdk => {  await cesdk.createDesignScene();  // create a Cloudinary upload widget  const myWidget = cloudinary.createUploadWidget(    {      cloudName: 'my-cloud-name',    },    (error, result) => {      if (!error && result && result.event === 'success') {        // refresh the asset panel after the image has been successfully uploaded        cesdk.engine.asset.assetSourceContentsChanged('cloudinary-images');      }    },  );
  // attach the widget to the upload button  document.getElementById('upload_widget').addEventListener('click', () => {    myWidget.open();  });});
```

```

In this example, we will show you how to customize the asset library in [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk).

The asset library is used to find assets to insert them into a scene or replace a currently selected asset. By default, we have already added a configuration of entries shown in the dock panel for images, text, stickers, shapes, and more. You can add and remove every entry or change the appearance of any entry.

Every entry has a couple of configuration options to determine what and how assets will be displayed. See the documentation on the [Asset Library Entry](nextjs/import-media/asset-panel/basics-f29078/) for more information.

```
  instance.ui.addAssetLibraryEntry({    id: 'empty-custom-asset-source',    sourceIds: ['emptySource'],    previewLength: 3,    gridColumns: 3,    gridItemHeight: 'square',    previewBackgroundType: 'contain',    gridBackgroundType: 'contain',    icon: ({ theme, iconSize }) => {      if (theme === 'dark') {        if (iconSize === 'normal') {          return 'https://img.ly/static/cesdk/guides/icon-normal-dark.svg';        } else {          return 'https://img.ly/static/cesdk/guides/icon-large-dark.svg';        }      }
      if (iconSize === 'normal') {        return 'https://img.ly/static/cesdk/guides/icon-normal-light.svg';      } else {        return 'https://img.ly/static/cesdk/guides/icon-large-light.svg';      }    }  });
  instance.ui.addAssetLibraryEntry({    id: 'empty-custom-asset-source-for-replace',    sourceIds: ['emptySource'],    previewLength: 3,    gridColumns: 3,    gridItemHeight: 'square'  });
  instance.ui.addAssetLibraryEntry({    id: 'custom-images',    sourceIds: ['ly.img.image'],    previewLength: 5,    gridColumns: 5,    icon: 'https://img.ly/static/cesdk/guides/icon-normal-dark.svg'  });
```

Adding, changing, or removing entries is done using the [Asset Library Entries API](nextjs/import-media/asset-panel/basics-f29078/). You can for example use `cesdk.ui.updateAssetLibraryEntry` to change the number of grid columns in the images library.

```
instance.ui.updateAssetLibraryEntry('ly.img.image', ({ entry }) => ({  ...entry,  gridColumns: 4}));
```

The basics of customizing the entries for replacement are the same as for insertion. The main difference is that these entries might vary depending on what block is currently selected and that the returned entries will determine if a replace action is shown on a selected block.

Most of the time it makes sense to provide a custom function to return different entries based on the type or fill of a block. If no replacement should be available for the current block, an empty array has to be returned. The UI will not show a replace button in that case.

As an argument to the callback, you will get the current context in the editor, mainly what blocks are selected, their block type as well as fills. This makes it more convenient to quickly decide what to return, but of course, you can also use the API for further checks as well.

```
instance.ui.setReplaceAssetLibraryEntries(  ({ defaultEntryIds, selectedBlocks }) => {    if (selectedBlocks.length !== 1) {      return [];    }    const [selectedBlock] = selectedBlocks;    if (selectedBlock.blockType === '//ly.img.ubq/graphic') {      return [...defaultEntryIds, 'empty-custom-asset-source-for-replace'];    }    return [];  });
```

If you do not use a custom `title` function for an entry, you need a translation provided with the following keys in the `i18n` configuration:

*   `libraries.<entry-id>.label` The label used in the dock panel
*   `libraries.<entry-id><group-id>.label` The label for groups for a given entry.
*   `libraries.<entry-id>.<source-id>.label` The label for a source in the source overview of a given entry
*   `libraries.<entry-id>.<source-id>.<group-id>.label` The label for a given group in the group overview for a given entry.
*   `libraries.<source-id>.label` The label used for a source in all entries
*   `libraries.<source-id><group-id>.label` The label for groups for source in all entries.

```
instance.i18n.setTranslations({  en: {    'libraries.empty-custom-asset-source.label': 'Empty'  }});
```

# Basics

An Asset Source is defined within the engine and can be seen as some sort of database of assets, it does not define how these assets are presented to the user. The web editor provides a versatile asset library that will display the assets in a user-friendly way inside a panel. However since an asset source does not provide any presentational information, the web editor needs to be told how to display the assets. This connection is made with an `Asset Library Entry`.

When you open the asset library, either by calling `openPanel` or adding a `ly.img.assetLibrary.dock` component to the dock, you must provide asset library entries. Only with these entries, the asset library will know what and how to display assets.

## Managing Asset Library Entries[#](#managing-asset-library-entries)

The CE.SDK web editor has an internal store of asset library entries that are referenced by asset libraries. You can find, add, remove, and update entries in this store.

```
CreativeEditorSDK.create('#cesdk', config).then(async (cesdk) => {  await cesdk.addDefaultAssetSources();  await cesdk.addDemoAssetSources({ withUploadAssetSources: true });
  await cesdk.createDesignScene();
  // Find all asset library entries  const entryIds = cesdk.ui.findAllAssetLibraryEntries();  if (entryIds.includes('ly.img.image')) {    // Add a new source id to the default image entry    cesdk.ui.updateAssetLibraryEntry('ly.img.image', {      sourceIds: ({ currentIds }) => [...currentIds, 'my.own.image.source'],    });  }
  // Add a new custom asset library entry  cesdk.ui.addAssetLibraryEntry({    id: 'my.own.image.entry',    sourceIds: ['my.own.image.source'],    sceneMode: 'Design',    previewLength: 5,    previewBackgroundType: 'cover',    gridBackgroundType: 'cover',    gridColumns: 2  });
  // Remove a default entry for stickers.  cesdk.ui.removeAssetLibraryEntry('ly.img.sticker');
```

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `findAllAssetLibraryEntries()` | Returns all available asset library entries by their id. |
| `addAssetLibraryEntry(entry)` | Adds a new asset library entry to the store. |
| `getAssetLibraryEntry(id)` | Returns the asset library entry for the given id if present and `undefined` otherwise. |
| `updateAssetLibraryEntry(id, entry)` | Updates the asset library entry for the given id with the provided entry object. It does not replace the entry but is merged with a present entry. |
| `removeAssetLibraryEntry(id)` | Removes the asset library entry for the given id. |

## Using Asset Library Entries[#](#using-asset-library-entries)

Asset library entries are used by an asset library. How the library gets the entries depends on the context. The main use case for a library is the dock. This is described in the [Dock API](nextjs/user-interface/customization/dock-cb916c/) documentation. We will describe further use cases here.

### Replace Asset Library[#](#replace-asset-library)

The fill of a block can be replaced with another asset. What assets are applicable is different for each block. The web editor provides a function `setReplaceAssetLibraryEntries`. It gets a function that is used to define what block should be replaced with what asset. It will get the current context (most importantly the selected block) and will return ids to asset library entries that shall be used by the replace asset library.

```
cesdk.ui.setReplaceAssetLibraryEntries(context => {  const { selectedBlocks, defaultEntryIds } = context;
  // Most of the time replace makes only sense if one block is selected.  if (selectedBlocks.length !== 1) {    // If no entry ids are returned, a replace button will not be shown.    return [];  }
  // id, block and fill type are provided for the selected block.  const { id, blockType, fillType } = selectedBlocks[0];  if (fillType === '//ly.img.ubq/fill/image') {    return ['my.own.image.entry'];  }
  return [];});
```

### Background Tracks Asset Library[#](#background-tracks-asset-library)

In the video timeline, the background track allows only certain type of assets. With `setBackgroundTrackAssetLibraryEntries` you can define what asset library entries are allowed for the background track when the user clicks on the “Add to Background Track” button.

```
// Only the image and video entries are allowed for the background track.cesdk.ui.setBackgroundTrackAssetLibraryEntries([  'ly.img.image',  'ly.img.video',]);
```

## Asset Library Entry Definition[#](#asset-library-entry-definition)

### Define What to Display[#](#define-what-to-display)

The following properties tell the asset library what data should be queried and displayed.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | The unique id of this entry that is referenced by other APIs and passed to the asset library. |
| `sourceIds` | `string[]` | Defines what asset sources should be queried by the asset library. |
| `excludeGroups` | `string[]` | If the asset sources support groups, these will be excluded and not displayed. |
| `includeGroups` | `string[]` | If the asset sources support groups, only these will be displayed and all other groups will be ignored. |
| `sceneMode` | `'Design'` or `'Video'` or `'All'` or (context) => `'Design'` or `'Video'` or `'All'` | If set, the asset library will use this entry exclusively in the respective scene mode. |

### Define How to Display[#](#define-how-to-display)

Besides properties that define what data should be displayed, there are also properties that specify how the data should be displayed to meet specific use case requirements.

#### Preview and Grid[#](#preview-and-grid)

Some settings are for the preview and some for the grid view. If multiple asset sources or groups within a source are used, the asset library will show short sections with only a few assets shown. This is what we call the preview. The grid view is the main view where all assets are shown.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | `string` or `((options: { group?: string; sourceId?: string }) => string` | Use for custom translation in the overviews for a group or a source. If undefined is returned by the function it will be handled like there wasn’t a title function set at all. |
| `canAdd` | `boolean'` or `'(sourceId: string) => boolean'` | If `true` an upload button will be shown and the uploaded file will be added to the source. Please note that the asset source needs to support `addAsset` as well. |
| `canRemove` | `boolean'` or `'(sourceId: string) => boolean'` | If `true` a remove button will be shown which will remove the asset from the source. Please note that the asset source needs to support `removeAsset` as well. |
| `promptBeforeApply` | `boolean` or `{ show: boolean, sourceIds?: string[] }` | If `true` a prompt will be shown before applying the asset to the block. If an object is provided, the prompt will only be shown for the specified sources. |
| `previewLength` | `number` | Defines how many assets will be shown in a preview section of a source or group. |
| `previewBackgroundType` | `cover` or `contain` | If the thumbUri is set as a background that will be contained or covered by the card in the preview view. |
| `gridBackgroundType` | `cover` or `contain` | If the thumbUri is set as a background that will be contained or covered by the card in the grid view. |
| `gridColumns` | `number` | Number of columns in the grid view. |
| `gridItemHeight` | `auto` or `square` | The height of an item in the grid view:  
\- `auto` automatically determines height yielding a masonry-like grid view.  
\- `square` every card will have the same square size. |
| `cardBorder` | `boolean` | Draws a border around the card if set to true. |
| `cardLabel` | `(assetResult: AssetResult) => string` | Overwrites the label of a card for a specific asset result |
| `cardLabelPosition` | `(assetResult: AssetResult) => 'inside' or 'below'` | Position of the label `inside` or `below` the card. |
| `cardLabelTruncateLines` | `(assetResult: AssetResult) => 'single' or 'multi'` | Controls label truncation to occur at end of first line (`single`), or at end of second line (`multi`). |
| `cardBackground` | `CardBackground[]` | Determines what will be used as the card background from the asset and in which priorities. The first preference for which the `path` returns a value will be used to decide what and how the background will be rendered. E.g. a path of `meta.thumbUri` will look inside the asset for a value `asset.meta.thumbUri`. This non-null value will be used.  
The type of preference decides how the card will render the background.  
  
`svgVectorPath` creates a `<svg>` element with the given vector path. Adapts the color depending on the theme. `image` uses a CSS background image |
| `sortBy` | The value can be one of the following:
*   `"None" ｜"Ascending" ｜"Descending"`
*   `{ sortingOrder?: "None" ｜ "Ascending" ｜ "Descending", sortKey?: string }`
*   `{ sourceId: string, sortingOrder?: "None" ｜"Ascending" ｜"Descending", sortKey?: string }[]`

 | Controls the sorting of asset source entries inside the asset library. This can be one of three possible values:

1.  `"None" ｜"Ascending" ｜"Descending"` applies the sorting direction for all sources.
2.  An object which defines the sort order via its `sortingOrder` key and an additional `sortKey` controlling the context of the sorting. This `sortKey` can be either any key which has been saved to the [Asset Source](nextjs/import-media/from-remote-source/unsplash-8f31f0/) or the special `id` value which uses the asset ids as a sorting context.
3.  An array which contains multiple of the above mentioned objects including a `sourceId` key defining to with asset source this configuration applies to.

When printing on a non-white medium or on a special medium like fabric or glass, printing your design over an underlayer helps achieve the desired result. An underlayer will typically be printed using a special ink and be of the exact shape of your design.

When exporting to PDF, you can specify that an underlayer be automatically generated in the [ExportOptions](nextjs/export-save-publish/export/overview-9ed3a8/). An underlayer will be generated by detecting the contour of all elements on a page and inserting a new block with the shape of the detected contour. This new block will be positioned behind all existing block. After exporting, the new block will be removed. The result will be a PDF file containing an additional shape of the same shape as your design and sitting behind it.

The ink to be used by the printer is specified in the [ExportOptions](nextjs/export-save-publish/export/overview-9ed3a8/) with a [spot color](nextjs/colors-a9b79c/). You can also adjust the scale of the underlayer shape with a negative or positive offset, in design units.

**Warning** Do not flatten the resulting PDF file or you will lose the underlayer shape which sits behind your design.

## Setup the scene[#](#setup-the-scene)

We first create a new scene with a graphic block that has a color fill.

```
  document.getElementById('cesdk_container').append(engine.element);
  const scene = engine.scene.create();
  const page = engine.block.create('page');  engine.block.setWidth(page, 800);  engine.block.setHeight(page, 600);  engine.block.appendChild(scene, page);
  engine.scene.zoomToBlock(page, 40, 40, 40, 40);
  const block = engine.block.create('graphic');  engine.block.setShape(block, engine.block.createShape('star'));  engine.block.setPositionX(block, 350);  engine.block.setPositionY(block, 400);  engine.block.setWidth(block, 100);  engine.block.setHeight(block, 100);
  const fill = engine.block.createFill('color');  engine.block.setFill(block, fill);  const rgbaBlue = { r: 0.0, g: 0.0, b: 1.0, a: 1.0 };  engine.block.setColor(fill, `fill/color/value`, rgbaBlue);
```

## Add the underlayer’s spot color[#](#add-the-underlayers-spot-color)

Here we instantiate a spot color with the known name of the ink the printer should use for the underlayer. The visual color approximation is not so important, so long as the name matches what the printer expects.

```
engine.editor.setSpotColorRGB('RDG_WHITE', 0.8, 0.8, 0.8);
```

## Exporting with an underlayer[#](#exporting-with-an-underlayer)

We enable the automatic generation of an underlayer on export with the option `exportPdfWithUnderlayer = true`. We specify the ink to use with `underlayerSpotColorName = 'RDG_WHITE'`. In this instance, we make the underlayer a bit smaller than our design so we specify an offset of 2 design units (e.g. millimeters) with `underlayerOffset = -2.0`.

```
await block  .export(page, {    mimeType: 'application/pdf',    exportPdfWithUnderlayer: true,    underlayerSpotColorName: 'RDG_WHITE',    underlayerOffset: -2.0  })  .then((blob) => {    const element = document.createElement('a');    element.setAttribute('href', window.URL.createObjectURL(blob));    element.setAttribute('download', 'underlayer_example.pdf');    element.style.display = 'none';    element.click();    element.remove();  });
```

# Options

Exporting via the `block.export` endpoint allows fine-grained control of the target format. CE.SDK currently supports exporting scenes, pages, groups, or individual blocks in the MP4, PNG, TGA, JPEG, WEBP, BINARY and PDF formats. To specify the desired type, just pass in the corresponding `mimeType`. Pass additional options in a mime-type specific object.

## Static Design Export Options[#](#static-design-export-options)

| Format | MimeType | Options (Default) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PNG | `image/png` | `pngCompressionLevel (5)` - The compression level is a trade-off between file size and encoding/decoding speed, but doesn’t affect quality. Valid values are `[0-9]` ranging from no to maximum compression. |
| JPEG | `image/jpeg` | `jpegQuality (0.9)` - Directly influences the resulting files visual quality. Smaller = worse quality, but lower file size. Valid values are `(0-1]` |
| WEBP | `image/webp` | `webpQuality (1.0)` - Controls the desired output quality. 1.0 results in a special lossless encoding that usually produces smaller file sizes than PNG. Valid values are (0-1\], higher means better quality. |
| BINARY | `application/octet-stream` | No additional options. This type returns the raw image data in RGBA8888 order in a blob. |
| PDF | `application/pdf` | `exportPdfWithHighCompatibility (true)` - Increase compatibility with different PDF viewers. Images and effects will be rasterized with regard to the scene’s DPI value instead of simply being embedded. |
| PDF | `application/pdf` | `exportPdfWithUnderlayer (false)` - An underlayer is generated by adding a graphics block behind the existing elements of the shape of the elements on the page. |
| PDF | `application/pdf` | `underlayerSpotColorName ("")` - The name of the spot color to be used for the underlayer’s fill. |
| PDF | `application/pdf` | `underlayerOffset (0.0)` - The adjustment in size of the shape of the underlayer. |

Certain formats allow additional configuration, e.g., `options.jpegQuality` controls the output quality level when exporting to JPEG. These format-specific options are ignored when exporting to other formats. You can choose which part of the scene to export by passing in the respective block as the first parameter.

For all formats, an optional `targetWidth` and `targetHeight` in pixels can be specified. If used, the block will be rendered large enough, that it fills the target size entirely while maintaining its aspect ratio. The supported export size limit can be queried with `editor.getMaxExportSize()`, the width and height should not exceed this value.

### PDF Export Performance[#](#pdf-export-performance)

The `exportPdfWithHighCompatibility` option controls how images and gradients are embedded in PDFs. When set to `false`, PDF exports can be **6-15x faster** for high-DPI content by embedding images directly instead of rasterizing them. However, this may cause rendering issues in Safari and macOS Preview with gradients that use transparency. See the [PDF conversion guide](nextjs/conversion/to-pdf-eb937f/) for detailed performance optimization guidance and testing recommendations.

## Video Export Options[#](#video-export-options)

*   `mimeType`
*   `h264Profile`
*   `h264Level`
*   `videoBitrate`
*   `audioBitrate`
*   `timeOffset`
*   `duration`
*   `framerate`
*   `targetWidth`
*   `targetHeight`
*   `abortSignal`

## Audio Export Options[#](#audio-export-options)

*   `mimeType`
*   `sampleRate`
*   `numberOfChannels`
*   `timeOffset`
*   `duration`
*   `skipEncoding`
*   `abortSignal`

## Export a Static Design[#](#export-a-static-design)

Export a design block element, e.g., a scene, a page, a group, or a single block, as a file of the given mime type.

```
export(handle: DesignBlockId, options?: ExportOptions): Promise<Blob>
```

Exports a design block element as a file of the given mime type. Performs an internal update to resolve the final layout for the blocks.

*   `handle`: The design block element to export.
*   `options`: The options for exporting the block type
*   Returns A promise that resolves with the exported image or is rejected with an error.

Export details:

*   Exporting automatically performs an internal update to resolve the final layout for all blocks.
*   Only blocks that belong to the scene hierarchy can be exported.
*   The export will include the block and all child elements in the block hierarchy.
*   If the exported block itself is rotated it will be exported without rotation.
*   If a margin is set on the block it will be included.
*   If an outside stroke is set on the block it will be included except for pages.
*   Exporting a scene with more than one page may result in transparent areas between the pages, it is recommended to export the individual pages instead.
*   Exporting as JPEG drops any transparency on the final image and may lead to unexpected results.

## Export with a Color Mask[#](#export-with-a-color-mask)

```
exportWithColorMask(handle: DesignBlockId, maskColorR: number, maskColorG: number, maskColorB: number, options?: ExportOptions): Promise<Blob[]>
```

Exports a design block element as a file of the given mime type. Performs an internal update to resolve the final layout for the blocks.

*   `handle`: The design block element to export.
*   `maskColorR`: The red component of the special color mask color.
*   `maskColorG`: The green component of the special color mask color.
*   `maskColorB`: The blue component of the special color mask color.
*   `options`: The options for exporting the block type
*   Returns A promise that resolves with an array of the exported image and mask or is rejected with an error.

Export details:

*   Removes all pixels that exactly match the given RGB color and replaces them with transparency.
*   The output includes two files: the masked image and the mask itself.

## Export a Video[#](#export-a-video)

Export a page as a video file of the given mime type.

```
exportVideo(handle: DesignBlockId, options?: VideoExportOptions): Promise<Blob>
```

Exports a design block as a video file of the given mime type. Note: The export will run across multiple iterations of the update loop. In each iteration a frame is scheduled for encoding.

*   `handle`: The design block element to export. Currently, only page blocks are supported.
*   `options`: The options for exporting the video.
*   Returns A promise that resolves with a video blob or is rejected with an error.

```
type VideoExportOptions = {  mimeType?: VideoMimeType;  onProgress?: (    numberOfRenderedFrames: number,    numberOfEncodedFrames: number,    totalNumberOfFrames: number,  ) => void;  h264Profile?: number;  h264Level?: number;  videoBitrate?: number;  audioBitrate?: number;  timeOffset?: number;  duration?: number;  framerate?: number;  targetWidth?: number;  targetHeight?: number;  abortSignal?: AbortSignal;};
```

Video export details:

*   Exporting automatically performs an internal update to resolve the final layout for all blocks and waits until all pending assets have been loaded.
*   Only blocks that belong to the scene hierarchy can be exported.
*   The given block determines the size, camera position, and rotation in the same manner as the static design export.
*   The given block does not influence the time offset and duration of the video. This can be controlled using the `timeOffset` and `duration` options.
*   The video resolution is determined by the largest page width and the largest page height. This can be overridden using the `targetWidth` and `targetHeight` options.
*   When using H.264, transparency info is lost and the video will be exported with a black background.

## Export Audio[#](#export-audio)

Export a page, audio block, video block, or track as an audio file of the given mime type.

```
exportAudio(handle: DesignBlockId, options?: AudioExportOptions): Promise<Blob>
```

Exports a design block as an audio file of the given mime type. Note: The export runs in a background worker and will run across multiple iterations of the update loop.

*   `handle`: The design block element to export. Currently supports page blocks, audio blocks, video blocks, and track blocks.
*   `options`: The options for exporting the audio.
*   Returns A promise that resolves with an audio blob or is rejected with an error.

```
type AudioExportOptions = {  mimeType?: AudioMimeType;  onProgress?: (    numberOfRenderedFrames: number,    numberOfEncodedFrames: number,    totalNumberOfFrames: number  ) => void;  sampleRate?: number;  numberOfChannels?: number;  timeOffset?: number;  duration?: number;  skipEncoding?: boolean;  abortSignal?: AbortSignal;};
```

Audio export details:

*   Exporting automatically performs an internal update to resolve the final layout for all blocks and waits until all pending assets have been loaded.
*   Only blocks that belong to the scene hierarchy can be exported.
*   **Supported block types**: Pages (`//ly.img.ubq/page`), audio blocks (`//ly.img.ubq/audio`), video fills (`//ly.img.ubq/fill/video`), and tracks (`//ly.img.ubq/track`).
*   When exporting a page, all audio from audio blocks, video fills, and other audio sources on the page will be mixed together.
*   When exporting an audio block, only that audio block’s audio will be exported, respecting its trim and duration settings.
*   When exporting a video block with audio, only the audio track from that video will be exported, respecting its trim and duration settings.
*   When exporting a track, all audio from blocks within that track will be mixed together.
*   The `timeOffset` option allows you to start the audio export from a specific time in seconds (default: 0).
*   The `duration` option allows you to specify the length of the exported audio in seconds. If not specified, the duration of the block is used.
*   The `sampleRate` option controls the sample rate of the exported audio in Hz (default: 48000).
*   The `numberOfChannels` option controls the number of audio channels (default: 2 for stereo).
*   The `skipEncoding` option allows exporting audio data directly without encoding (default: false).
*   Supported mime types: `audio/wav` for WAV format and `audio/mp4` for M4A/AAC format.

## Export Information[#](#export-information)

Before exporting, the maximum export size and available memory can be queried.

```
getMaxExportSize(): number
```

Get the export size limit in pixels on the current device. An export is only possible when both the width and height of the output are below or equal this limit. However, this is only an upper limit as the export might also not be possible due to other reasons, e.g., memory constraints.

*   Returns The upper export size limit in pixels or an unlimited size, i.e, the maximum signed 32-bit integer value, if the limit is unknown.

```
getAvailableMemory(): number
```

Get the currently available memory in bytes.

*   Returns The currently available memory in bytes.

## Exporting via the Export button[#](#exporting-via-the-export-button)

When a user triggers an export by clicking the corresponding button in the navigation bar, the editor will call the `exportDesign` callback. By default, this exports the current page and downloads it to the user’s device. You can customize this behavior by registering your own callback implementation.

```
// Register custom export handlercesdk.actions.register('exportDesign', async options => {  // Use the utils API to perform the export  const { blobs, options: exportOptions } = await cesdk.utils.export(options);
  // Custom handling - e.g., upload to CDN instead of download  await uploadToYourCDN(blobs);});
```

To enable the export button in the navigation bar, see the configuration of elements for further information.

# Size Limits

CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) supports exporting high-resolution image, video, and audio content, but there are practical limits to consider based on the user’s device capabilities.

## Image Resolution Limits[#](#image-resolution-limits)

| Constraint | Recommendation / Limit |
| --- | --- |
| **Input Resolution** | Maximum input resolution is **4096×4096 pixels**. Images from external sources (e.g., Unsplash) are resized to this size before rendering on the canvas. You can modify this value using the `maxImageSize` setting. |
| **Output Resolution** | There is no enforced output resolution limit. Theoretically, the editor supports output sizes up to **16,384×16,384 pixels**. However, practical limits depend on the device’s GPU capabilities and available memory. |

All image processing in CE.SDK is handled client-side, so these values depend on the **maximum texture size** supported by the user’s hardware. The default limit of 4096×4096 is a safe baseline that works universally. Higher resolutions (e.g., 8192×8192) may work on certain devices but could fail on others during export if the GPU texture size is exceeded.

To ensure consistent results across devices, it’s best to test higher output sizes on your target hardware and set conservative defaults in production.

## Video Resolution & Duration Limits[#](#video-resolution--duration-limits)

| Constraint | Recommendation / Limit |
| --- | --- |
| **Resolution** | Up to **4K UHD** is supported for **playback** and **export**, depending on the user’s hardware and available GPU resources. For **import**, CE.SDK does not impose artificial limits, but maximum video size is bounded by the **32-bit address space of WebAssembly (wasm32)** and the **browser tab’s memory cap (~2 GB)**. |
| **Frame Rate** | 30 FPS at 1080p is broadly supported; 60 FPS and high-res exports benefit from hardware acceleration |
| **Duration** | Stories and reels of up to **2 minutes** are fully supported. Longer videos are also supported, but we generally found a maximum duration of **10 minutes** to be a good balance for a smooth editing experience and a pleasant export duration of around one minute on modern hardware. |

Performance scales with client hardware. For best results with high-resolution or high-frame-rate video, modern CPUs/GPUs with hardware acceleration are recommended.

# Buffers

```
// Create an audio block and append it to the pageconst audioBlock = engine.block.create('audio');engine.block.appendChild(page, audioBlock);
// Create a bufferconst audioBuffer = engine.editor.createBuffer();
// Reference the audio buffer resource from the audio blockengine.block.setString(audioBlock, 'audio/fileURI', audioBuffer);
// Generate 10 seconds of stereo 48 kHz audio dataconst samples = new Float32Array(10 * 2 * 48000);for (let i = 0; i < samples.length; i += 2) {  samples[i] = samples[i + 1] = Math.sin((440 * i * Math.PI) / 48000);}
// Assign the audio data to the bufferengine.editor.setBufferData(audioBuffer, 0, new Uint8Array(samples.buffer));
// We can get subranges of the buffer dataconst chunk = engine.editor.getBufferData(audioBuffer, 0, 4096);

```
setBufferData(uri: string, offset: number, data: Uint8Array): void
```

```
setBufferLength(uri: string, length: number): void
```

Set the length of a buffer.

*   `uri`: The URI of the buffer to update.
*   `length`: The new length of the buffer in bytes.

```
getBufferLength(uri: string): number
```

*   `key`: The variable’s key.
*   `value`: The text to replace the variable with.

```
getString(key: string): string
```

Set a text variable.

*   `key`: The variable’s key.
*   Returns The text value of the variable.

```
remove(key: string): void
```

[Source](https:/img.ly/docs/cesdk/nextjs/create-templates/add-dynamic-content/placeholders-d9ba8a)

# Placeholders

A unique feature of the `Creator` role is that it allows the user to define various Placeholders for every element which contain Constraints that can be individually set. Such constraints only apply to users with non-creator roles and define in which way such users are allowed to interact with this element.

For example, in the following image, an element has been defined as a Placeholder and the constraints have been set accordingly so that other users can only change its contents. The element is now selectable by default but cannot be deleted, styled or duplicated by users outside the role of `Creator`.

## Defining Placeholders and setting Constraints[#](#defining-placeholders-and-setting-constraints)

Placeholders can be defined by users with the `Creator` role from the element itself…

![](/docs/cesdk/_astro/placeholder-oncanvas-light.Cy40qw6B_pXR35.webp)

…or from the Inspector.  

![](/docs/cesdk/_astro/placeholder-inspector-light.Sa5A1Pz4_1NyiEW.webp)

Constraints can then be set by opening the Placeholder menu. Additionally, Placeholders may also be removed from said menu, which means they are reverted back to regular non-editable elements.

By default, elements that were not defined as Placeholders by a `Creator` cannot be selected and modified by a non-creator user.

## Identifying elements defined as Placeholders as a non-creator user[#](#identifying-elements-defined-as-placeholders-as-a-non-creator-user)

Users outside the role of `Creator` may interact with elements defined as Placeholders. To identify all of these elements users may click on the canvas to shortly highlight them.

# Text Animations

When applied to text blocks, some animations allow you to control whether the animation should be applied to the entire text at once, line by line, word by word or character by character.

We can use the `setEnum(id: number, value: number): void` API in order to change the text writing style. Call `engine.block.getEnumValues('textAnimationWritingStyle')` in order to get a list of currently supported text writing style options. The default writing style is `Line`.

In this example, we set the easing to `Word` so that the text animates in one word at a time.

```
const text = engine.block.create('text');const textAnimation = engine.block.createAnimation('baseline');engine.block.setInAnimation(text, textAnimation);engine.block.appendChild(page, text);engine.block.setPositionX(text, 100);engine.block.setPositionY(text, 100);engine.block.setWidthMode(text, 'Auto');engine.block.setHeightMode(text, 'Auto');engine.block.replaceText(  text,  'You can animate text\nline by line,\nword by word,\nor character by character\nwith CE.SDK',);engine.block.setEnum(textAnimation, 'textAnimationWritingStyle', 'Word');engine.block.setDuration(textAnimation, 2.0);engine.block.setEnum(textAnimation, 'animationEasing', 'EaseOut');
```

Together with the writing style, you can also configure the overlap between the individual segments of a text animation using the `textAnimationOverlap` property.

With an overlap value of `0`, the next segment only starts its animation once the previous segment’s animation has finished. With an overlap value of `1`, all segments animate at the same time.

CreativeEditor SDK supports many different types of configurable animations for animating the appearance of design blocks in video scenes.

Similarly to blocks, each animation object has a numeric id which can be used to query and [modify its properties](nextjs/concepts/blocks-90241e/).

## Accessing Animation APIs[#](#accessing-animation-apis)

In order to query whether a block supports animations, you should call the `supportsAnimation(id: number): boolean` API.

```
if (!engine.block.supportsAnimation(graphic)) {  return;}
```

```
const slideInAnimation = engine.block.createAnimation('slide');const breathingLoopAnimation = engine.block.createAnimation('breathing_loop');const fadeOutAnimation = engine.block.createAnimation('fade');
```

## Assigning Animations[#](#assigning-animations)

In order to assign an _In_ animation to the block, call the `setInAnimation(id: number, animation: number): void` API.

```
engine.block.setInAnimation(graphic, slideInAnimation);
```

In order to assign a _Loop_ animation to the block, call the `setLoopAnimation(id: number, animation: number): void` API.

```
engine.block.setLoopAnimation(graphic, breathingLoopAnimation);
```

In order to assign an _Out_ animation to the block, call the `setOutAnimation(id: number, animation: number): void` API.

```
engine.block.setOutAnimation(graphic, fadeOutAnimation);
```

To query the current animation ids of a design block, call the `getInAnimation(id: number): number`, `getLoopAnimation(id: number): number` or `getOutAnimation(id: number): number` API. You can now pass this id into other APIs in order to query more information about the animation, e.g. its type via the `getType(id: number): string` API.

```
const animation = engine.block.getLoopAnimation(graphic);const animationType = engine.block.getType(animation);
```

When replacing the animation of a design block, remember to destroy the previous animation object if you don’t intend to use it any further. Animation objects that are not attached to a design block will never be automatically destroyed.

Destroying a design block will also destroy all of its attached animations.

```
const squeezeLoopAnimation = engine.block.createAnimation('squeeze_loop');engine.block.destroy(engine.block.getLoopAnimation(graphic));engine.block.setLoopAnimation(graphic, squeezeLoopAnimation);/* The following line would also destroy all currently attached animations */// engine.block.destroy(graphic);
```

## Animation Properties[#](#animation-properties)

Just like design blocks, animations with different types have different properties that you can query and modify via the API. Use `findAllProperties(id: number): string[]` in order to get a list of all properties of a given animation.

For the slide animation in this example, the call would return `['name', 'animation/slide/direction', 'animationEasing', 'includedInExport', 'playback/duration', 'type', 'uuid']`.

Please refer to the [API docs](nextjs/animation/types-4e5f41/) for a complete list of all available properties for each type of animation.

```
const allAnimationProperties =  engine.block.findAllProperties(slideInAnimation);
```

Once we know the property keys of an animation, we can use the same APIs as for design blocks in order to modify those properties. For example, we can use `setFloat(id: number, property: string, value: number): void` in order to change the direction of the slide animation to make our block slide in from the top.

```
engine.block.setFloat(  slideInAnimation,  'animation/slide/direction',  0.5 * Math.PI);
```

All animations have a duration. For _In_ and _Out_ animations, the duration defines the total length of the animation as described above. For _Loop_ animations, the duration defines the length of each loop cycle.

We can use the `setDuration(id: number, value: number): void` API in order to change the animation duration.

Note that changing the duration of an _In_ animation will automatically adjust the duration of the _Out_ animation (and vice versa) in order to avoid overlaps between the two animations.

```
engine.block.setDuration(slideInAnimation, 0.6);
```

Some animations allow you to configure their easing behavior by choosing from a list of common easing curves. The easing controls the acceleration throughout the animation.

We can use the `setEnum(id: number, value: number): void` API in order to change the easing curve. Call `engine.block.getEnumValues('animationEasing')` in order to get a list of currently supported easing options.

In this example, we set the easing to `EaseOut` so that the animation starts fast and then slows down towards the end. An `EaseIn` easing would start slow and then speed up, while `EaseInOut` starts slow, speeds up towards the middle of the animation and then slows down towards the end again.

```
engine.block.setEnum(slideInAnimation, 'animationEasing', 'EaseOut');console.log(  'Available easing options:',  engine.block.getEnumValues('animationEasing'));
```

GitHub](https://github.com/imgly/cesdk-web-examples/tree/main/guides-export-audio-browser)

  

The `exportAudio` API allows you to extract audio from any block that contains audio content. This is particularly useful when integrating with external audio processing services like speech-to-text transcription, audio enhancement, or music analysis platforms.

Audio can be exported from multiple block types:

*   **Page blocks** - Export the complete mixed audio timeline
*   **Video blocks** - Extract audio tracks from videos
*   **Audio blocks** - Export standalone audio content
*   **Track blocks** - Export audio from specific timeline tracks

## Export Audio[#](#export-audio)

Export audio from any block using the `exportAudio` API:

```
const page = cesdk.engine.scene.getCurrentPage();
const audioBlob = await cesdk.engine.block.exportAudio(page, {  mimeType: 'audio/wav',  sampleRate: 48000,  numberOfChannels: 2});
```

### Export Options[#](#export-options)

Configure your audio export with these options:

*   **`mimeType`** - `'audio/wav'` (uncompressed) or `'audio/mp4'` (compressed AAC)
*   **`sampleRate`** - Audio quality in Hz (default: 48000)
*   **`numberOfChannels`** - 1 for mono or 2 for stereo
*   **`timeOffset`** - Start time in seconds (default: 0)
*   **`duration`** - Length to export in seconds (0 = entire duration)
*   **`onProgress`** - Callback function receiving `(rendered, encoded, total)` for progress tracking

## Find Audio Sources[#](#find-audio-sources)

To find blocks with audio in your scene:

```
// Find audio blocksconst audioBlocks = cesdk.engine.block.findByType('audio');
// Find video blocks with audioconst videoFills = cesdk.engine.block.findByType('//ly.img.ubq/fill/video');const videosWithAudio = videoFills.filter(block => {  try {    return cesdk.engine.block.getAudioInfoFromVideo(block).length > 0;  } catch {    return false;  }});
```

## Working with Multi-Track Video Audio[#](#working-with-multi-track-video-audio)

Videos can contain multiple audio tracks (e.g., different languages). CE.SDK provides APIs to inspect and extract specific tracks.

### Check audio track count[#](#check-audio-track-count)

```
const videoFillId = cesdk.engine.block.findByType('//ly.img.ubq/fill/video')[0];
const trackCount = cesdk.engine.block.getAudioTrackCountFromVideo(videoFillId);console.log(`Video has ${trackCount} audio track(s)`);
```

### Get track information[#](#get-track-information)

```
const audioTracks = cesdk.engine.block.getAudioInfoFromVideo(videoFillId);
audioTracks.forEach((track, index) => {  console.log(`Track ${index}:`, {    channels: track.channels,      // 1=mono, 2=stereo    sampleRate: track.sampleRate,  // Sample rate in Hz    language: track.language,      // e.g., "en", "es"    label: track.label             // Track description  });});
```

### Extract a specific track[#](#extract-a-specific-track)

```
// Create audio block from track 0 (first track)const audioBlockId = cesdk.engine.block.createAudioFromVideo(videoFillId, 0);
// Export just this track's audioconst trackAudioBlob = await cesdk.engine.block.exportAudio(audioBlockId, {  mimeType: 'audio/wav'});
```

### Extract all tracks[#](#extract-all-tracks)

```
// Create audio blocks for all tracksconst audioBlockIds = cesdk.engine.block.createAudiosFromVideo(videoFillId);
// Export each trackfor (let i = 0; i < audioBlockIds.length; i++) {  const trackBlob = await cesdk.engine.block.exportAudio(audioBlockIds[i]);  console.log(`Track ${i}: ${trackBlob.size} bytes`);}
```

## Complete Workflow: Audio to Captions[#](#complete-workflow-audio-to-captions)

A common workflow is to export audio, send it to a transcription service, and use the returned captions in your scene.

### Step 1: Export Audio[#](#step-1-export-audio)

```
const page = cesdk.engine.scene.getCurrentPage();
const audioBlob = await cesdk.engine.block.exportAudio(page, {  mimeType: 'audio/wav',  sampleRate: 48000,  numberOfChannels: 2});
```

### Step 2: Send to Transcription Service[#](#step-2-send-to-transcription-service)

Send the audio to a service that returns SubRip (SRT) format captions:

```
async function transcribeAudio(audioBlob) {  const formData = new FormData();  formData.append('audio', audioBlob, 'audio.wav');  formData.append('format', 'srt');
  const response = await fetch('https://api.transcription-service.com/transcribe', {    method: 'POST',    headers: {      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'    },    body: formData  });
  // Returns SRT format text  return await response.text();}
const srtContent = await transcribeAudio(audioBlob);
```

### Step 3: Import Captions from SRT[#](#step-3-import-captions-from-srt)

Use the built-in API to create caption blocks from the SRT response:

```
// Create a file from the SRT textconst srtFile = new File([srtContent], 'captions.srt', {  type: 'application/x-subrip'});
// Create object URL and import captionsconst uri = URL.createObjectURL(srtFile);const captions = await cesdk.engine.block.createCaptionsFromURI(uri);URL.revokeObjectURL(uri);
// Add captions to pageconst page = cesdk.engine.scene.getCurrentPage();const captionTrack = cesdk.engine.block.create('//ly.img.ubq/captionTrack');
captions.forEach(caption => {  cesdk.engine.block.appendChild(captionTrack, caption);});
cesdk.engine.block.appendChild(page, captionTrack);
// Center the first caption as a reference pointcesdk.engine.block.alignHorizontally([captions[0]], 'Center');cesdk.engine.block.alignVertically([captions[0]], 'Center');
```

### Other Processing Services[#](#other-processing-services)

Audio export also supports these workflows:

*   **Audio enhancement** - Noise removal, normalization
*   **Music analysis** - Tempo, key, beat detection
*   **Language detection** - Identify spoken language
*   **Speaker diarization** - Identify who spoke when

## Next Steps[#](#next-steps)

Now that you understand audio export, explore related audio and video features:

*   [Add Captions](nextjs/edit-video/add-captions-f67565/) - Learn how to create and sync caption blocks with audio content
*   [Control Audio and Video](nextjs/create-video/control-daba54/) - Master time offset, duration, and playback controls for audio blocks
*   [Trim Video Clips](nextjs/edit-video/trim-4f688b/) - Apply the same trim concepts to isolate audio segments

# Interface: Reaction

Reactions track read calls and provide a way to react if they change.

*   Read calls are tracked by passing a function to `track`. That function will be executed, and any read calls made during that execution will be tracked and associated with this reaction.
*   Reactions can be subscribed to by passing a callback to `subscribe`. That callback will be executed whenever any of the read calls associated with this reaction change.

## Methods[#](#methods)

### track()[#](#track)

```
track<T>(cb): T;
```

Execute the callback and track all engine read calls that happen during the execution. These read calls are associated with this reaction.

#### Type Parameters[#](#type-parameters)

[Source](https:/img.ly/docs/cesdk/nextjs/api/engine/interfaces/htmlcreativeenginecanvaselement)

# Interface: HTMLCreativeEngineCanvasElement

A wrapper around a plain canvas

The idea is to shield the user from the weird semantics of changing width and height of a canvas by making this a opaque block element instead and managing the internal render resolution of the canvas dynamically

## Extends[#](#extends)

*   `HTMLElement`

## Methods[#](#methods)

### clear()[#](#clear)

```
clear(): void;
```

Clear the canvas

This is useful when mounting the canvas into a new position in the DOM. If the canvas is not cleared, it will appear in the new DOM position, with its contents stretched to the new size. It will re-render correctly during the next animation frame, but for a brief moment the canvas contents can flash distorted.

Call `clear()` before mounting into the DOM to avoid this. This will cause the canvas to be cleared until rendering the next frame.

#### Returns[#](#returns)

`void`

### setURIResolver()[#](#seturiresolver)

  

Sets a custom URI resolver.

This function can be called more than once. Subsequent calls will overwrite previous calls. To remove a previously set resolver, pass the value `null`. The given function must return an absolute path with a scheme and cannot be asynchronous. The input is allowed to be invalid URI, e.g., due to placeholders.

```
// Replace all .jpg files with the IMG.LY logoengine.editor.setURIResolver((uri) => {  if (uri.endsWith('.jpg')) {    return 'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/imgly_logo.jpg';  }  // Make use of the default URI resolution behavior.  return engine.editor.defaultURIResolver(uri);});
```

#### Parameters[#](#parameters-44)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Experimental Features[#](#experimental-features)

Experimental APIs that may change or be removed in future versions.

### unstable\_setVideoExportInactivityTimeout()[#](#unstable_setvideoexportinactivitytimeout)

Configure the timeout for video export inactivity detection.

Some browsers exhibit a bug where support for certain video codecs is offered, but when attempting to decode or encode in these codecs, the request will simply never return. We detect that situation using a timeout. To prevent this mechanism from triggering in situations where the export simply takes long because of a slow device, you can configure the timeout here.

#### Parameters[#](#parameters-5)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `timeout` | `number` | Timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 10 seconds. This API is experimental and may change or be removed in future versions. |

#### Returns[#](#returns-9)

`void`

* * *

### unstable\_setExportInactivityTimeout()[#](#unstable_setexportinactivitytimeout)

Configure the timeout for block-exports in WebWorkers.

If exporting a block hangs because resources take too long to initialize, the export will be aborted after this many ms.

#### Parameters[#](#parameters-6)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `timeout` | `number` | Timeout in milliseconds (default: 10 000) This API is experimental and may change or be removed in future versions. |

#### Returns[#](#returns-10)

`void`

# Class: BlockAPI

Create, manipulate, and query the building blocks of your design.

This is the primary interface for all block-level operations. Use it to manage the entire lifecycle of blocks from creation and serialization to destruction. You can precisely control a block’s appearance by modifying its fills, strokes, and effects, or transform its position, size, and rotation. The API also includes powerful features for managing complex content like text and video, organizing blocks into groups and hierarchies, and exporting final designs to various formats.

## Constructors[#](#constructors)

### Constructor[#](#constructor)

  

`BlockAPI`

## Block Lifecycle[#](#block-lifecycle)

Manage the complete lifecycle: create, find, duplicate, destroy, and serialize blocks.

### loadFromString()[#](#loadfromstring)

| --- | --- | --- |
| `content` | `string` | A string representing the given blocks. |

#### Returns[#](#returns)

`Promise`<`number`\[\]>

#### Signature[#](#signature)

```
loadFromString(content: string): Promise<number[]>
```

* * *

### loadFromArchiveURL()[#](#loadfromarchiveurl)

  

Loads blocks from a remote archive URL.

# Interface: HTMLCreativeEngineCanvasElement

A wrapper around a plain canvas

The idea is to shield the user from the weird semantics of changing width and height of a canvas by making this a opaque block element instead and managing the internal render resolution of the canvas dynamically

## Extends[#](#extends)

*   `HTMLElement`

## Methods[#](#methods)

### clear()[#](#clear)

```
clear(): void;
```

Clear the canvas

This is useful when mounting the canvas into a new position in the DOM. If the canvas is not cleared, it will appear in the new DOM position, with its contents stretched to the new size. It will re-render correctly during the next animation frame, but for a brief moment the canvas contents can flash distorted.

Call `clear()` before mounting into the DOM to avoid this. This will cause the canvas to be cleared until rendering the next frame.

# Class: SceneAPI

Create, load, save, and manipulate scenes.

Scenes are the root element of every design hierarchy. Their children, stacks of pages, individual pages or other blocks, define the content of the design. Scenes can be created from scratch, loaded from a file or URL, or created from an image or video. After manipulation, they can be saved to a string or an archive. This allows further processing in another editor instance, automated processing in scripts or sharing with other users.

## Scene Creation[#](#scene-creation)

Create new scenes from scratch or from media files.

### create()[#](#create)

zoomToBlock(   id,   paddingLeft?,   paddingTop?,   paddingRight?,paddingBottom?): Promise<void>;
```

Sets the zoom and focus to show a block.

This only shows an effect if the zoom level is not handled/overwritten by the UI. Without padding, this results in a tight view on the block.

```
// Bring entire scene in view with padding of 20px in all directionsengine.scene.zoomToBlock(scene, 20.0, 20.0, 20.0, 20.0);
```

##### Parameters[#](#parameters-23)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `number` | The block that should be focused on. |
| `paddingLeft?` | `number` | Optional padding in screen pixels to the left of the block. |
| `paddingTop?` | `number` | Optional padding in screen pixels to the top of the block. |
| `paddingRight?` | `number` | Optional padding in screen pixels to the right of the block. |
| `paddingBottom?` | `number` | Optional padding in screen pixels to the bottom of the block. |

##### Returns[#](#returns-32)

`Promise`<`void`\>

A promise that resolves once the zoom was set or rejects with an error otherwise.

##### Deprecated[#](#deprecated)

Use zoomToBlock with options object instead

#### Signatures[#](#signatures)

```
zoomToBlock(id: number, options?: ZoomOptions): Promise<void>
```

```
zoomToBlock(id: number, paddingLeft?: number, paddingTop?: number, paddingRight?: number, paddingBottom?: number): Promise<void>
```

* * *

### enableZoomAutoFit()[#](#enablezoomautofit)

  

Continually adjusts the zoom level to fit the width or height of a block’s axis-aligned bounding box.

This only shows an effect if the zoom level is not handled/overwritten by the UI. Without padding, this results in a tight view on the block. No more than one block per scene can have zoom auto-fit enabled. Calling `setZoomLevel` or `zoomToBlock` disables the continuous adjustment.

```
// Follow page with padding of 20px horizontally before and after the blockengine.scene.enableZoomAutoFit(page, 'Horizontal', 20, 20)
```

##### Parameters[#](#parameters-24)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `number` | The block for which the zoom is adjusted. |
| `axis` | `"Horizontal"` | `"Vertical"` |

# Class: FeatureAPI

Controls the availability of features within the Creative Editor SDK.

The FeatureAPI allows you to enable or disable specific functionality within the editor based on custom conditions or user permissions.

## Understanding the Feature System[#](#understanding-the-feature-system)

The feature system uses a **predicate chain** to determine if a feature is enabled. There are two types of predicates:

1.  **Boolean predicates** (e.g., `true` or `false`) - These are **always terminal** and immediately return their value.
2.  **Function predicates** - The implementation decides whether to call `isPreviousEnable()` (continue chain) or return directly (end chain).

### Evaluation Order[#](#evaluation-order)

  

Predicates are evaluated in this order:

1.  **`set()` predicates** (most recent first) - Evaluated **FIRST**
2.  **`enable()`/`disable()` state** - Evaluated **LAST**

This means **`set()` can override `enable()` and `disable()`**.

## Common Use Cases and Expected Outcomes[#](#common-use-cases-and-expected-outcomes)

### Use Case 1: Simple Enable/Disable[#](#use-case-1-simple-enabledisable)

```
// Enable a feature with its default behaviorcesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.delete');// isEnabled: true
// Disable itcesdk.feature.disable('ly.img.delete');// isEnabled: false
// Re-enable itcesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.delete');// isEnabled: true
```

**Expected outcome:** `enable()` and `disable()` work together to toggle features on/off.

### Use Case 2: Custom Conditions with `set()`[#](#use-case-2-custom-conditions-with-set)

```
// Enable delete only when something is selectedcesdk.feature.set('ly.img.delete', ({ engine }) => {  return engine.block.findAllSelected().length > 0;});// isEnabled: depends on selection
// Now calling disable() won't work because set() is evaluated first!cesdk.feature.disable('ly.img.delete');// isEnabled: still depends on selection (disable is ignored)
```

**Expected outcome:** `set()` function predicates are evaluated before `disable()`, so `disable()` has no effect when a `set()` predicate exists.

### Use Case 3: Terminal Boolean Predicates[#](#use-case-3-terminal-boolean-predicates)

```
cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.delete'); // Default predicate: truecesdk.feature.set('ly.img.delete', false); // Adds false to front// Chain: [set(false), enable(true)]// Evaluation: false (stops here, never reaches enable)// isEnabled: false
cesdk.feature.set('ly.img.delete', true); // Adds true to front// Chain: [set(true), set(false), enable(true)]// Evaluation: true (stops here, never reaches the rest)// isEnabled: true
```

**Expected outcome:** The most recent `set()` call with a boolean wins because boolean predicates are terminal.

### Use Case 4: Layering Conditions with Functions[#](#use-case-4-layering-conditions-with-functions)

```
// Base: Feature enabled by defaultcesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.delete');
// Layer 1: Add selection requirementcesdk.feature.set('ly.img.delete', ({ isPreviousEnable, engine }) => {  const baseEnabled = isPreviousEnable(); // Checks enable(true)  const hasSelection = engine.block.findAllSelected().length > 0;  return baseEnabled && hasSelection;});// isEnabled: true only if enabled AND has selection
// Layer 2: Add mode requirementcesdk.feature.set('ly.img.delete', ({ isPreviousEnable, engine }) => {  const previousEnabled = isPreviousEnable(); // Checks Layer 1  const isDesignMode = engine.scene.getMode() === 'Design';  return previousEnabled && isDesignMode;});// isEnabled: true only if all conditions met (mode + selection + enabled)
```

**Expected outcome:** Each `set()` call with a function can build on previous conditions by calling `isPreviousEnable()`.

### Use Case 5: Overriding with `set()`[#](#use-case-5-overriding-with-set)

```
cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.delete');cesdk.feature.disable('ly.img.delete');// isEnabled: false (disable overrides enable)
// But set() overrides both:cesdk.feature.set('ly.img.delete', true);// Chain: [set(true), disable(false)]// isEnabled: true (set is terminal, disable never evaluated)
```

**Expected outcome:** `set()` with a boolean always wins because it’s evaluated first and is terminal.

### Use Case 6: Glob Patterns for Bulk Operations[#](#use-case-6-glob-patterns-for-bulk-operations)

```
// Enable all video features at oncecesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.video.*');
// Disable all crop featurescesdk.feature.disable('ly.img.crop.*');
// Set custom predicate for all navigation featurescesdk.feature.set('ly.img.navigation.*', ({ engine }) => {  return engine.scene.getMode() === 'Design';});
// Check if all video features are enabledconst allVideoEnabled = cesdk.feature.isEnabled('ly.img.video.*');// Returns true only if ALL matching features are enabled
```

**Expected outcome:** Glob patterns match multiple features. `isEnabled()` with a glob returns `true` only if **all** matching features are enabled.

### Use Case 7: Role-Based Access Control[#](#use-case-7-role-based-access-control)

```
const userRole = 'editor'; // Could be 'viewer', 'editor', 'admin'
cesdk.feature.set('ly.img.delete', () => {  return userRole === 'editor' || userRole === 'admin';});
cesdk.feature.set('ly.img.settings', () => {  return userRole === 'admin';});
```

**Expected outcome:** Features are enabled based on user roles, with predicates evaluated on every check.

## Key Principles[#](#key-principles)

1.  **Use `enable()` for simple on/off** - Works with default predicates
2.  **Use `disable()` to turn off enabled features** - Only works if no `set()` predicates exist
3.  **Use `set()` for custom logic** - Overrides `enable()`/`disable()`
4.  **Boolean predicates are terminal** - Stop evaluation immediately
5.  **Function predicates can chain** - Call `isPreviousEnable()` to continue
6.  **Most recent `set()` wins** - Evaluated in LIFO order (most recent first)
7.  **Glob patterns affect multiple features** - Use `*` as wildcard

## Constructors[#](#constructors)

### Constructor[#](#constructor)

  

`FeatureAPI`

## Feature Control[#](#feature-control)

Methods for enabling and checking the status of editor features based on custom predicates.

### enable()[#](#enable)

  

Enables one or more features using their default predicates.

This is the recommended way to enable features. Each feature has a sensible default predicate that determines when it should be available in the UI. To customize the behavior, use the `set()` method instead.

Supports glob patterns (e.g., ‘ly.img.video.\*’) to enable multiple features at once. Use `*` as a wildcard to match any sequence of characters.

##### Parameters[#](#parameters)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `featureId` |  | [`FeatureId`](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/nextjs/api/cesdk-js/type-aliases/featureid/) |

##### Returns[#](#returns)

`void`

##### Examples[#](#examples)

Enable single feature with its default predicate:

```
cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.delete');
```

Enable multiple features at once:

```
cesdk.feature.enable(['ly.img.delete', 'ly.img.duplicate']);
```

Enable all video features using a glob pattern:

```
cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.video.*');
```

Enable all navigation features:

```
cesdk.feature.enable('ly.img.navigation.*');
```

#### Call Signature[#](#call-signature)

```
enable(featureId, predicate): void;
```

##### Parameters[#](#parameters-1)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `featureId` |  | [`FeatureId`](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/nextjs/api/cesdk-js/type-aliases/featureid/) |
| `predicate` | [`FeaturePredicate`](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/nextjs/api/cesdk-js/type-aliases/featurepredicate/) | The condition that determines if the feature is enabled. |

##### Returns[#](#returns-1)

`void`

##### Deprecated[#](#deprecated)

Use `cesdk.feature.set(featureId, predicate)` instead. This overload will be removed in a future version.

Enables one or more features based on the provided predicate.

#### Signatures[#](#signatures)

```
enable(featureId: FeatureId | FeatureId[]): void
```

```
enable(featureId: FeatureId | FeatureId[], predicate: FeaturePredicate): void
```

* * *

### disable()[#](#disable)

  

Disables one or more features.

This is a convenience method that adds a `false` predicate to the feature’s predicate chain, effectively disabling the feature. Disabled features will not be shown in the UI.

Supports glob patterns (e.g., ‘ly.img.video.\*’) to disable multiple features at once. Use `*` as a wildcard to match any sequence of characters.

#### Parameters[#](#parameters-2)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `featureId` |  | [`FeatureId`](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/nextjs/api/cesdk-js/type-aliases/featureid/) |

#### Returns[#](#returns-2)

`void`

#### Examples[#](#examples-1)

Disable a single feature:

cesdk.feature.disable('ly.img.delete');
```

Disable multiple features at once:

```
cesdk.feature.disable([  'ly.img.delete',  'ly.img.duplicate',  'ly.img.group']);
```

Disable all video features using a glob pattern:

```
cesdk.feature.disable('ly.img.video.*');
```

Disable all crop features:

```
cesdk.feature.disable('ly.img.crop.*');
```

#### Signature[#](#signature)

```
disable(featureId: FeatureId | FeatureId[]): void
```

* * *

### set()[#](#set)

  

Sets a feature’s enabled state, replacing any existing predicates.

This method provides a unified way to enable or disable features. When setting to `true`, the feature’s default predicate is used. When setting to `false`, the feature is explicitly disabled. You can also provide a custom predicate function for advanced control.

Supports glob patterns (e.g., ‘ly.img.video.\*’) to set multiple features at once. Use `*` as a wildcard to match any sequence of characters.

```

Disable all video features using a glob pattern:

```
cesdk.feature.set('ly.img.video.*', false);
```

Enable all filter features with a custom predicate:

```
cesdk.feature.set('ly.img.filter.*', ({ engine }) => {  // Only enable filters for images  const selected = engine.block.findAllSelected();  return selected.some(id => engine.block.getType(id) === '//ly.img.ubq/graphic');});
```

```
set(featureId: FeatureId, enabled: FeaturePredicate): void
```

* * *

### list()[#](#list)

## Experimental Features[#](#experimental-features)

Experimental APIs that may change or be removed in future versions.

### unstable\_setVideoExportInactivityTimeout()[#](#unstable_setvideoexportinactivitytimeout)

Configure the timeout for video export inactivity detection.

Some browsers exhibit a bug where support for certain video codecs is offered, but when attempting to decode or encode in these codecs, the request will simply never return. We detect that situation using a timeout. To prevent this mechanism from triggering in situations where the export simply takes long because of a slow device, you can configure the timeout here.

#### Parameters[#](#parameters-5)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `timeout` | `number` | Timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 10 seconds. This API is experimental and may change or be removed in future versions. |

#### Returns[#](#returns-9)

`void`

* * *

### unstable\_setExportInactivityTimeout()[#](#unstable_setexportinactivitytimeout)

Configure the timeout for block-exports in WebWorkers.

If exporting a block hangs because resources take too long to initialize, the export will be aborted after this many ms.

#### Parameters[#](#parameters-6)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `timeout` | `number` | Timeout in milliseconds (default: 10 000) This API is experimental and may change or be removed in future versions. |

#### Returns[#](#returns-10)

`void`

# Class: BlockAPI

Create, manipulate, and query the building blocks of your design.

This is the primary interface for all block-level operations. Use it to manage the entire lifecycle of blocks from creation and serialization to destruction. You can precisely control a block’s appearance by modifying its fills, strokes, and effects, or transform its position, size, and rotation. The API also includes powerful features for managing complex content like text and video, organizing blocks into groups and hierarchies, and exporting final designs to various formats.

## Block Lifecycle[#](#block-lifecycle)

Manage the complete lifecycle: create, find, duplicate, destroy, and serialize blocks.

### loadFromString()[#](#loadfromstring)

  

Loads blocks from a serialized string.

The blocks are not attached by default and won’t be visible until attached to a page or the scene. The UUID of the loaded blocks is replaced with a new one.

#### Parameters[#](#parameters)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `content` | `string` | A string representing the given blocks. |

#### Returns[#](#returns)

`Promise`<`number`\[\]>

A promise that resolves with a list of handles representing the found blocks or an error.

#### Example[#](#example)

```
const serializedBlocks = await engine.block.saveToString([pageBlockId]);// Later, load those blocksconst loadedBlocks = await engine.block.loadFromString(serializedBlocks);// Attach the first loaded block to the sceneengine.block.appendChild(sceneBlockId, loadedBlocks[0]);
```

#### Signature[#](#signature)

```
loadFromString(content: string): Promise<number[]>
```

* * *

### loadFromArchiveURL()[#](#loadfromarchiveurl)

  

Loads blocks from a remote archive URL.

The URL should be that of a file previously saved with `block.saveToArchive`. The blocks are not attached by default and won’t be visible until attached to a page or the scene. The UUID of the loaded blocks is replaced with a new one.

#### Parameters[#](#parameters-1)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | `string` | The URL of the blocks archive file. |

#### Returns[#](#returns-1)

`Promise`<`number`\[\]>

A promise that resolves with a list of handles representing the found blocks or an error.

#### Example[#](#example-1)

```
// Load blocks from a remote archiveconst loadedBlocks = await engine.block.loadFromArchiveURL('https://example.com/blocks.zip');// Attach the first loaded block to the sceneengine.block.appendChild(sceneBlockId, loadedBlocks[0]);
```

| `onDisallowedResourceScheme?` | (`url`, `dataHash`) => `Promise`<`string`\> | An optional callback that is called for each resource URL that has a scheme absent from `resourceSchemesAllowed`. The `url` parameter is the resource URL and the `dataHash` parameter is the hash of the resource’s data. The callback should return a new URL for the resource, which will be used in the serialized scene. The callback is expected to return the original URL if no persistence is needed. |

#### Returns[#](#returns-2)

`Promise`<`string`\>

A promise that resolves to a string representing the blocks or an error.

#### Example[#](#example-2)

```
// Create a page with a text elementconst page = engine.block.create('page');const text = engine.block.create('text');engine.block.appendChild(page, text);
// Save the whole page hierarchy to a stringconst serialized = await engine.block.saveToString([page]);
